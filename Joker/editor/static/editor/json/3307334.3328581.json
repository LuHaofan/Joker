However, a limitation of existing systems is that they often sense only a narrow part of the light spectrum. We argue that the ability to sense a broad light spectrum significantly enhances ability of such systems expanding possible application scenarios. We demonstrate our work in progress to develop the concept of polymorphic light sensing~(PLS). PLS sensor morphs itself according to applications requirements, to track desired parts of the light spectrum (colours, infrared, and ultraviolet light). We couple the PLS sensor with ultra-low power backscatter mechanism, and demonstrate this enables us to sense and communicate the broad spectrum, while operating battery-free.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["polymorphic sensing", "light sensing", "battery-free", "backscatter communication"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
