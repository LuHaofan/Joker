However, existing visible light localization systems require customized light hardware, which increases deployment cost and hinders near term adoption. In this paper, we propose LiTell, a simple and robust localization scheme that employs unmodified fluorescent lights (FLs) as location landmarks and commodity smartphones as light sensors. LiTell builds on the key observation that each FL has an inherent characteristic frequency which can serve as a discriminative feature. It incorporates a set of sampling, signal amplification and camera optimization mechanisms, that enable a smartphone to capture the extremely weak and high frequency ( &gt; 80 kHz) features. We have implemented LiTell as a real-time localization and navigation system on Android. Our experiments demonstrate LiTell's high reliability in discriminating different FLs, and its potential to achieve sub-meter location granularity. Our user study in a multi-storey office building, parking lot and grocery store further validates LiTell as an accurate, robust and ready-to-use indoor localization system.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "13", "keywords": ["smartphones", "image processing", "visible light localization", "indoor localization", "visible light sensing", "signal processing"], "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
