In this paper, we propose VSkin, a system that supports fine-grained gesture-sensing on the back of mobile devices based on acoustic signals. VSkin utilizes both the structure-borne sounds, i.e., sounds propagating through the structure of the device, and the air-borne sounds, i.e., sounds propagating through the air, to sense finger tapping and movements. By measuring both the amplitude and the phase of each path of sound signals, VSkin detects tapping events with an accuracy of 99.65% and captures finger movements with an accuracy of 3.59mm.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "15", "keywords": ["ultrasound", "touch gestures"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
