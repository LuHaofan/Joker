However, existing researches are usually limited to some independent algorithms, while not able to apply multiple algorithms to accommodate various types of attack in actual deployment. In this paper, we propose and implement a novel SDS framework, which aims to flexibly deploy a variety of security functions and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to automatically learn ongoing threats and proactively protect the network from attacks.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["autodetection", "intelligence", "software defined security", "defense"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
