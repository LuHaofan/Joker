However, a key missing piece remains: fault tolerance. This is especially critical as the network is no longer stateless and pure endpoint recovery does not suffice. In this paper, we design and implement RedPlane, a fault-tolerant state store for stateful in-switch applications. This provides in-switch applications consistent access to their state, even if the switch they run on fails or traffic is rerouted to an alternative switch. We address key challenges in devising a practical, provably correct replication protocol and implementing it in the switch data plane. Our evaluations show that RedPlane incurs negligible overhead and enables end-to-end applications to rapidly recover from switch failures.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGCOMM 2021 Conference", "numpages": "22", "keywords": ["state replication", "programmable networks", "programmable switches", "fault tolerance"], "location": "Virtual Event, USA", "series": "SIGCOMM '21"}
