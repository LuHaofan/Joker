Consider a BCI command to be a word consisting of a sequence of characters. Each character is a thought or action that can be reliably detected through brain waves. For this work, we specifically consider eye-blinks as the user action of interest. Eye-blinks are an interesting modality for BCI commands because of their easy detectability and naturalness (and hence covertness). It turns out that there is an interesting trade-off between the complexity of characters and the length of words. In this work, we perform a user-study to answer a simple, but important, question pertaining to eye-blinks based BCI command design: do users prefer shorter characters (and hence longer words) or shorter words (and hence longer characters) when performing commands?. We present a simple eye-blink language consisting of words and characters and use real user-experiments to study the aforementioned trade-off.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["brain-computer interfaces (BCIS)", "eye-blinks"], "location": "Niagara Falls, New York, USA", "series": "MobiSys '17"}
