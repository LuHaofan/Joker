In the mobile and pervasive computing community, there was a struggle on data collection for the evaluation of human-sensing systems. An automated and contactless solution to collect data from users at home is one way that can help in the continuation of user-centric studies. In this poster, we present a portable system for remote, in-home data collection. The system is powered by a Raspberry Pi\u00a9 and input peripherals (a camera, a microphone, and a wireless receiver). Our system uses a speech interface for text-to-speech and speech-to-text conversions. The system acts as a voice-based \"smart agent\" that guides the user during an experiment session. We aim to use our system to collect data from a set of smart pill bottles that we previously designed for medication adherence monitoring [1] and user identification [3].", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["data collection", "smart agent", "portable system", "smart pillbox"], "location": "Virtual Event, Wisconsin", "series": "MobiSys '21"}
