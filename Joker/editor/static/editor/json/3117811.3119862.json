Differently from traditional generators, whose goal is creating packet flows which emulate specific applications and protocols, our focus is generating a combined radio signal, as seen by a gateway, given by the super-position of the signals transmitted by multiple sensors simultaneously active on the same channel. We argue that such a generator can be of interest for testing different network planning solutions for LoRa networks.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["wireless", "LoRa", "LP-WAN", "traffic generator", "chirp spread spectrum"], "location": "Snowbird, Utah, USA", "series": "MobiCom '17"}
