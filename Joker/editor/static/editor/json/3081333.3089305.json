Existing systems rely on motion information, which usually fail to detect occupied rooms with stationary people. In this project, we study the possibility of converting commodity WiFi access points to occupancy sensors by exploiting multipath reflections as individual spatial sensors. The proposed method measures fine-grained distortions caused by human body on phase and amplitude of WiFi signals. Our initial results suggest that formulating WiFi parameters into angle of arrival provides a more sensitive metric to measure occupancy.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["CSI", "WiFi", "occupancy detection", "multipath propagation"], "location": "Niagara Falls, New York, USA", "series": "MobiSys '17"}
