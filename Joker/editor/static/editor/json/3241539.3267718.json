To date, however, even the most effective CTC systems require these devices to operate in the same ISM band (eg. 2.4GHz) because of the conventional wisdom that wireless transceivers with different (fundamental) frequencies cannot communicate with one another. In this demo, we present a practical CTC application, called \\o{}ursystem, allowing a 2.4GHz WiFi receiver (eg. a smartphone) to identify UHF RFID tags, which operates at the spectrum between 840~920MHz. \\o{}ursystem leverages the underlying harmonic backscattering of tags to open a second channel and uses it to communicate with WiFi receivers. We design and implement \\o{}ursystem with commodity WiFi chipsets. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that \\o{}ursystem allows WiFi receivers to identify UHF RFID tags within the range of $2$ m and with a median goodput of 95%, which is comparable to today's mobile RFID readers.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["WiFi", "harmonic backscatter", "cross-frequency communication", "RFID", "TiFi"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
