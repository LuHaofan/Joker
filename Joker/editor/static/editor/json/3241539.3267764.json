Despite all its capabilities, the introduction of various architectural entities of SDN poses many security threats and potential target. Especially, Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) is a rapidly growing attack that poses a tremendous threat to both control plane and forwarding plane of SDN. Asthe control layer is vulnerable to DDoS attack, the goal of this paper is to provide a defense system which is based on Learning Automata (LA) concepts. It is a self-operating mechanism that responds to a sequence of actions in a certain way to achieve a specific goal. The simulation results show that this scheme effectively reduces the TCP connection setup delay due to DDoS attack.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["DDoS", "LA", "SDN", "failure rate"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
