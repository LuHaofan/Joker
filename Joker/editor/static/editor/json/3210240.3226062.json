In turn, edge computing needs infrastructure decentralisation. What is not necessarily established yet is that infrastructure decentralisation needs a distributed model of Internet governance and decentralised trust schemes. We discuss the features of a decentralised IoT and edge-computing ecosystem and list the components that need to be designed, as well the challenges that need to be addressed.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 16th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["Blockchain", "Edge-Computing", "Programmable Privacy", "Distributed Trust"], "location": "Munich, Germany", "series": "MobiSys '18"}
