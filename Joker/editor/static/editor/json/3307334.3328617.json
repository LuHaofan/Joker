The controllers are placed in a distributed manner in a network for reliability and load balancing. However, the placement of controllers considering the whole network is not an efficient approach because applying the objective function to the overall network is a challenging task. Therefore, the division of the network into clusters makes the assignment of the switches to the controller more efficient. The placement of the controller in a cluster not only reduces the latency between the switches and the controller but other objectives such as reliability, load balancing, robustness and energy saving can also be applied to the clusters. Therefore, in this poster, a multi-criteria-decision-making (MCDM) scheme known as the Analytical Network Process (ANP) is proposed for controller place selection using clustering.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["analytical network process", "SDN", "controller placement problem", "multi-objective"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
