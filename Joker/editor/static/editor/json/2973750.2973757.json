Proteus allows for network service and network component functionality to be specified in templates. These templates are used by the Proteus orchestrator to realize and modify service instances based on the specifics of a service creation request and the availability of resources in the mobile SDI and allows for service specific policies to be implemented. We evaluate our Proteus prototype in a realistic mobile networking testbed illustrating its ability to support service evolution.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "14", "keywords": ["data centric", "software defined infrastructure", "orchestration", "service evolution", "mobile networks", "templates"], "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
