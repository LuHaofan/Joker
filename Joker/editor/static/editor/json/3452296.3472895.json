Shoofly leverages optical signal quality and traffic demand telemetry from a large commercial cloud provider to identify optical bypasses in the cloud WAN that reduce the hardware cost of long-haul capacity by 40%. A key challenge is that optical bypasses cause signals to travel longer distances on fiber before re-generation, potentially reducing link capacities and resilience to optical link failures. Despite these challenges, Shoofly provisions bypass-enabled topologies that meet 8X the present-day demands using existing network hardware. Even under aggressive stochastic and deterministic link failure scenarios, these topologies save 32% of the cost of long-haul capacity.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGCOMM 2021 Conference", "numpages": "13", "keywords": ["optical bypass", "traffic engineering", "backbone design"], "location": "Virtual Event, USA", "series": "SIGCOMM '21"}
