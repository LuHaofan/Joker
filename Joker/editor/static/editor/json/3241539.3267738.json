These servers aim to employ MPTCP to leverage multiple connections including wireless over a public network. In this paper, we show that the default MPTCP design does not adequately support reliability in these environments, which makes it unfit for use in edge clouds. We propose RAMPTCP, an extension to MPTCP which focuses on adding reliability over network paths.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["container migration", "receiver-assisted", "MPTCP", "edge clouds"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
