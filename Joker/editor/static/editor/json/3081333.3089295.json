We combined a compact synchronous generator with a battery with 10% of the capacity of a UPS of the same rating to produce an uninterruptible generator supply (UGS). The controller of this UGS runs FreeRTOS, which enables it to respond quickly to a power outage. A wifi module provides connectivity to a web server for real-time monitoring and management on a remote PC or cellphone.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["UGS", "mobile power management", "freertos"], "location": "Niagara Falls, New York, USA", "series": "MobiSys '17"}
