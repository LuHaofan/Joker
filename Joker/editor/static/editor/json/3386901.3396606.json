To monitor air pollutants, with the maturity of wireless sensor network, low-cost air sensors are deployed to trace pollution sources and detect personal exposure. Regular quality audit of deployed sensors is essential to ensure data quality of large-scale air monitoring networks. However, inspecting tremendous sensors by professional technicians regularly will take much human resources. This paper proposed the key sensor discovery for efficient and effective quality audit of large-scale air sensor network.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["air monitoring sensor network", "quality audit", "correlation model", "key sensor"], "location": "Toronto, Ontario, Canada", "series": "MobiSys '20"}
