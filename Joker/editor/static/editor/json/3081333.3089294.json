Fine-grained atomic mobile services are not so convenient for end users to reuse. Considering that in identical or similar service domains, a great deal of the business logics and functions are reusable within the scope. So we present a template-based framework to allow reuse of services and to achieve rapid mobile application development. The reusable fine-grained service logics and functions are encapsulated into comparatively coarse-grained templates, from which the designers can create the personalized composite services and edit the templates efficiently.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["mobile application development environment", "cross-platform mobile application development", "template based service creation", "rapid mobile application development"], "location": "Niagara Falls, New York, USA", "series": "MobiSys '17"}
