Various studies on experimental psychology have showed several factors which affects subjective time. Those factors should be partially captured by ubiquitous sensors such as smartphones and wearable devices, therefore, we tackle to create common and individual model for subjective time based on the sensor data. We report our first prototype implementation for the framework based on AWARE framework with adding experience sampling method for subjective time recognition. In addition, we discuss potential applications which leveraging advantages of subjective time as context.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["experience sampling method", "context-awareness", "subjective time"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
