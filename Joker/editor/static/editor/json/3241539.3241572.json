The proposed solution, SWAN, builds an array of stitched antennas extended from the radio chains of commodity Wi-Fi. SWAN has low hardware cost and provides easy-to-use interfaces embedded in the Linux kernel. Two application cases for wireless sensing and communication are presented that proves the usefulness of the solution. SWAN is able to provide over 3\\texttimes{} performance improvement on Wi-Fi azimuth estimation and localization and over 30% improvement on Wi-Fi throughput over original Wi-Fi AP with three fixed antennas.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "16", "keywords": ["antenna extension", "antenna switching", "localization", "antenna slection", "aoa estimation", "spatial diversity", "mimo"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
