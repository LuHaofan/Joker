However, for real-world MIMO deployments, estimating the downlink wireless channel from each antenna on the base station to every client device is a critical bottleneck, especially for the widely used frequency duplexed designs that cannot utilize reciprocity. Typically, this channel estimation requires explicit feedback from client devices and is prohibitive for large antenna deployments. In this paper, we present FIRE, a system that uses an end-to-end machine learning approach to enable accurate channel estimation without requiring any feedback from client devices. FIRE is interpretable, accurate, and has low compute overhead. We show that FIRE can successfully support MIMO transmissions in a real-world testbed and achieves SNR improvement over 10 dB in MIMO transmissions compared to the current state-of-the-art.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 27th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "14"}
