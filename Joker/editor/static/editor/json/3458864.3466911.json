To detect face liveness, AIME creates multiple image patterns on the authentication screen as a challenge, then captures meaningful corneal specular reflection responses from user's eyes using the front camera, and analyzes the reflective pattern images using various lightweight Machine Learning (ML) techniques under a subsecond level delay (200 ms). We demonstrate that AIME can detect various attacks, including digital images displayed on the phone or tablet, printed paper images, 2D paper masks, videos, 3D silicon masks, and 3D facial models using VR. AIME liveness detection can be applied for various contactless biometric authentication accurately and efficiently without any costly extra sensors.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["presentation attack detection", "anti-spoofing", "liveness detection"], "location": "Virtual Event, Wisconsin", "series": "MobiSys '21"}
