To address the unique issues in underwater environment such as water flow and scattered sunlight interference, we exploit the circularly polarized light (CPL) and double links for underwater VLC transmission. A coding scheme tailored for underwater communication based on double CPL design is developed. We prototype Shrimp on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) LEDs with fabricated printed circuit boards (PCBs). Extensive experiments conducted in an indoor water pool, a lake, and the sea demonstrate that Shrimp can combat against environmental interference and achieve robust communication in underwater environments. The communication distance can be up to 3 m in sea/lake water using a 3 W commodity LED, outperforming the VLC schemes designed for in-air communication.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 27th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "13"}
