Animalborne sensors, particularly GPS-equipped collars, are used to enhance real-time wildlife protection. Innovations that can be integrated into these systems can immediately scale, offering broad application. GPS tracking data streams have been valuable to resolve a number of conservation challenges, but these systems have not been particularly effective in identifying poaching in real-time. Detecting poaching events is a critical need to provide actionable information for law enforcement.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["poaching", "shockwave", "low-power", "acoustics", "wearable"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
