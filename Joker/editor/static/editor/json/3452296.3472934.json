Such caches are often accessed via remote procedure call (RPC), as RPC frameworks provide rich support for productionization, including protocol versioning, memory efficiency, auto-scaling, and hitless upgrades. However, full-featured RPC limits performance and scalability as it incurs high latencies and CPU overheads. Remote Memory Access (RMA) offers a promising alternative, but meeting productionization requirements can be a significant challenge with RMA-based systems due to limited programmability and narrow RMA primitives.This paper describes the design, implementation, and experience derived from CliqueMap, a hybrid RMA/RPC caching system. CliqueMap has been in production use in Google's datacenters for over three years, currently serves more than 1PB of DRAM, and underlies several end-user visible services. CliqueMap makes use of performant and efficient RMAs on the critical serving path and judiciously applies RPCs toward other functionality. The design embraces lightweight replication, client-based quoruming, self-validating server responses, per-operation client-side retries, and co-design with the network layers. These foci lead to a system resilient to the rigors of production and frequent post deployment evolution.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGCOMM 2021 Conference", "numpages": "13", "keywords": ["remote memory access", "key-value caching system", "remote procedure call"], "location": "Virtual Event, USA", "series": "SIGCOMM '21"}
