However, a limitation of recent backscatter systems is that the communication range scales with the strength of the ambient carrier signal~(ACS). This means that to achieve a long-range, a backscatter tag needs to reflect a strong ACS, which in practice means that it needs to be close to an ACS emitter. We present TunnelScatter, a mechanism that overcomes this limitation. TunnelScatter uses a tunnel diode-based radio frequency oscillator to enable transmissions when there is no ACS, and the same oscillator as a reflection amplifier to support backscatter transmissions when the ACS is weak. Our results show that even without an ACS, TunnelScatter is able to transmit through several walls covering a distance of 18m while consuming a peak biasing power of SI57 microwatt. Based on TunnelScatter, we design battery-free sensor tags, called TunnelTags, that can sense physical phenomena and transmit them using the TunnelScatter mechanism.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "17", "keywords": ["backscatter", "gesture recognition", "energy harvesting", "tunnel diodes", "battery-free", "light sensing"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
