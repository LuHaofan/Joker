We focus on channel access mechanism problems in the same environment. To solve these we modify Distributed Coordination function (DCF) by adding ambient light measurement slot. The result shows modified DCF can handle the problems.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["distributed coordination function", "CTS", "RTS", "VLC"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
