This has attracted rapid research in the development of chemical sensors which can non-invasively measure analytes available in raw biofluids such as sweat, tears and urine. Of all the available raw bio-fluids, sweat can be obtained non-intrusively and readily, and thus is the most suitable choice for continuous real-time monitoring of indicators at a molecular level.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["wearables", "ph sensing", "sweat sensor", "iot"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
