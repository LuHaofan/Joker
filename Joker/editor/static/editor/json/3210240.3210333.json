Unleashing those capabilities can enable innovative applications on off-the-shelf devices. In this work, we demonstrate how to transmit raw IQ samples from a large buffer on Wi-Fi chips. We further show how to extract channel state information (CSI) on a per frame basis. As a proof-of-concept application, we build a covert channel on top of Wi-Fi to stealthily exchange information between two devices by prefiltering Wi-Fi frames prior to transmission. On the receiver side, the CSI is used to extract the embedded information. By means of experimentation, we show that regular Wi-Fi clients can still demodulate the underlying Wi-Fi frames. Our results show that covert channels on the physical layer are practical and run on off-the-shelf smartphones. By making available our raw signal transmitter, the CSI extractor, and the covert channel application to the research community, we ensure reproducibility and offer a platform for further innovative applications on Wi-Fi devices.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 16th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "13", "location": "Munich, Germany", "series": "MobiSys '18"}
