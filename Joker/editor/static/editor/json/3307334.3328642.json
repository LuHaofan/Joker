However, current MBMLs suffer some limitations, since virtualization of network brings new challenges such as the dynamic topology and elasticity. Those limitations include the high dependency on previous knowledge and the difficulty to represent the model. To face those limitations, we propose SAKURA: a root cause analysis framework for the virtual Ip Multimedia Subsystem (vIMS). SAKURA is composed of a self-modeling and a constraints solver.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["root cause analysis", "self-modeling", "service function chain"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
