Unfortunately, any change in sensor resolution leads to a substantial pause in frame delivery -- as much as 280 ms. Frame delivery is bottlenecked by a sequence of reconfiguration procedures and memory management in current operating systems before it resumes at the new resolution. This latency from reconfiguration impedes the adoption of otherwise beneficial resolution-energy tradeoff mechanisms. We propose Banner as a media framework that provides a rapid sensor resolution reconfiguration service as a modification to common media frameworks, e.g., V4L2. Banner completely eliminates the frame-to-frame reconfiguration latency (226 ms to 33 ms), i.e., removing the frame drop during sensor resolution reconfiguration. Banner also halves the end-to-end resolution reconfiguration latency (226 ms to 105 ms). This enables a more than 49% reduction of system power consumption by allowing continuous vision applications to reconfigure the sensor resolution to 480p compared with downsampling from 1080p to 480p, as measured in a cloud-based offloading workload running on a Jetson TX2 board. As a result, Banner unlocks unprecedented capabilities for mobile vision applications to dynamically reconfigure sensor resolutions to balance the energy efficiency and task accuracy tradeoff.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["operating systems", "device drivers", "energy efficiency", "resolution-based tradeoff", "efficient visual computing", "reconfiguration"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
