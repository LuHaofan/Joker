A typical mechanism to interface with a personal device is via a touch screen, in which users use their fingertip or stylus to scroll, type, select, or otherwise control device usage. Touch-based techniques, however, can become restrictive or inconvenient under a variety of scenarios. For example, personal devices such as phones or tablets are continuously increasing in size, making one-handed interaction difficult because one cannot easily hold the phone and touch the screen (with the thumb) at the same time with one hand. Therefore, in this demo, we present a new technique to interact with personal devices in which the screen and touch screen interactions can adapt to a user's grip or current touch constraints.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["adaptive interface", "user interface programming", "hand-held device", "intelligent interface", "gesture input", "mobile computing"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
