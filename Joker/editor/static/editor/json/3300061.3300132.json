Although environmentally friendly, the rapid promotion of electric taxis raises problems to both taxi drivers and governments, e.g., prolonged waiting/charging time, unbalanced utilization of charging infrastructures and reduced taxi supply due to the long charging time. In this paper, we make the first effort to understand the long-term evolving patterns through a five-year study on one of the largest electric taxi networks in the world, i.e., the Shenzhen electric taxi network in China. In particular, we perform a comprehensive measurement investigation called ePat to explore the evolving mobility and charging patterns of electric vehicles. Our ePat is based on 4.8 TB taxi GPS data, 240 GB taxi transaction data, and metadata from 117 charging stations, during an evolving process from 427 electric taxis in 2013 to 13,178 in 2018. Moreover, ePat also explores the impacts of various contexts and benefits during the evolving process. Our ePat as a comprehensive investigation of the electric taxi network mobility and charging evolving has the potential to advance the understanding of the evolving patterns of electric taxi networks and pave the way for analyzing future shared autonomous vehicles.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "12", "keywords": ["evolving experience", "shared autonomous vehicle", "electric vehicle", "mobility pattern", "charging pattern"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
