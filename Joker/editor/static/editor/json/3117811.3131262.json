Our solution takes a blackbox approach to secure IoT edge-networks. We combine user and device-centric context-information together with network data to classify network communication as normal or malicious. We have designed a dual-layer traffic classification scheme based on fuzzy logic, where the classification model is trained remotely. The remotely trained model is then used by the edge gateway to classify the network traffic. We have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype and evaluate its performance in a real world environment. Theevaluation shows that IoTurva causes very small overhead while it works with minimal hardware, and that our model training and classification approach can improve system efficiency and privacy.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["IoT", "security", "access-control", "SDN", "networks"], "location": "Snowbird, Utah, USA", "series": "MobiCom '17"}
