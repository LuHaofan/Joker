To manage such demanding applications, a fine-grained control of end-to-end paths is imperative. End-to-end delay estimation and forecast techniques were essential traffic engineering tools even before the mobile edge computing paradigm pushed the cloud closer to the end user. In this paper, we model the path selection problem for edge traffic engineering using a risk minimization technique inspired by portfolio theory in economics, and we use machine learning to estimate the risk of a path. In particular, using real latency time series measurements, collected with and without the GENI testbed, we compare four short-horizon latency estimation techniques, commonly used by the finance community to estimate prices of volatile financial instruments. Our initial results suggest that a Bayesian Network approach may lead to good latency estimation performance and open a few research questions that we are currently exploring.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["portfolio theory", "edge computing", "latency prediction", "machine learning", "Bayesian network"], "location": "Snowbird, Utah, USA", "series": "MobiCom '17"}
