These customer needs can be quite diverse and usually include provisioning/upgrade, account/billing, device and service performance related issues. The resolution process of these customer needs is largely manual and tedious. The resolution process not only affects the customer experience but could also entails cost on customer care and network operations of the mobile service providers. We present TREAT, which aims at automatically identifying opportunities for auto-resolving customer reported needs, and hence improving customer experiences and reducing cost for customer care and network operations.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["automation", "instruction recommendation"], "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
