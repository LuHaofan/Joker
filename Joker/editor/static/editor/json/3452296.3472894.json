The vRAN is more efficient than traditional RANs, as it multiplexes several base station workloads on the same compute hardware. Our measurements show that, whilst this multiplexing provides efficiency gains, more than 50% of the CPU cycles in typical vRAN settings still remain unused. A way to further improve CPU utilization is to collocate the vRAN with general-purpose workloads. However, to maintain performance, vRAN tasks have sub-millisecond latency requirements that have to be met 99.999% of times. We show that this is difficult to achieve with existing systems. We propose Concordia, a userspace deadline scheduling framework for the vRAN on Linux. Concordia builds prediction models using quantile decision trees to predict the worst case execution times of vRAN signal processing tasks. The Concordia scheduler is fast (runs every 20 us) and the prediction models are accurate, enabling the system to reserve a minimum number of cores required for vRAN tasks, leaving the rest for general-purpose workloads. We evaluate Concordia on a commercial-grade reference vRAN platform. We show that it meets the 99.999% reliability requirements and reclaims more than 70% of idle CPU cycles without affecting the RAN performance.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGCOMM 2021 Conference", "numpages": "17", "keywords": ["edge computing", "prediction model", "5G", "machine learning", "NFV", "real-time scheduling", "vRAN", "mobile networks"], "location": "Virtual Event, USA", "series": "SIGCOMM '21"}
