ArmTroi can achieve real-time 3D arm skeleton tracking and reliable gesture inference tolerant to missing wearable sensors for enabling numerous useful application designs. We have coped with two major challenges through ArmTroi. First, the skeleton of each arm is determined from the locations of the elbow and wrist, whereas a wearable device only senses a single point from the wrist. We find that the potential solution space is huge. This underconstrained nature fundamentally challenges the achievement of accurate and real-time arm skeleton tracking. Second, wearable sensors may not reliably provide sensory data. For example, devices are not worn by the user, yet the learning tools for gesture inference, such as deep learning, typically have static network structures, which require nontrivial network adaptation to match the input's varying availability and ensure reliable gesture inference. We propose effective techniques to address above challenges, and all computations can be conducted on the user's smartphone. ArmTroi is thus a fully lightweight and portable system. We develop a prototype and extensive evaluation shows the efficacy of the ArmTroi design.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "13", "keywords": ["arm tracking", "deep learning", "gesture inference", "mobile sensing"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
