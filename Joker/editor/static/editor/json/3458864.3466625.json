Based on our proposed Seed-Assisted Specification method, we start to investigate this topic by looking closely into one emergency call failure case in China. Using what we learned from the case as prior knowledge, we build a formal model of emergency call systems with proper granularity. By running model checking, four public-unaware scenarios where emergency calls cannot be correctly routed are discovered. Additionally, we extract configurations of two major U.S. carriers and incorporate them as model constraints into the model. Based on the augmented model, we find two new attacks leveraging the privileges of emergency calls. Finally, we present a solution with marginal overhead to resolve issues we can foresee.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "14", "keywords": ["emergency call", "formal methods", "protocol formal verification", "cellular network protocol", "protocol specification"], "location": "Virtual Event, Wisconsin", "series": "MobiSys '21"}
