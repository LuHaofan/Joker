GENI's edge computing strategy proceeds by deploying self-contained packages of network, computing, storage resources, or GENI Racks [2] connected via high speed fiber to LTE BS(s) across twelve campuses in the US, all interconnected via a nationwide research network. The GENI mobile computing resource manager is based on the Orbit Management framework (OMF) [3] and provides seamless access to the edge computing resources via the GENI Portal for experimentation, scheduling, data collection and processing.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["network slicing", "mobile edge computing", "distributed testbeds", "GENI racks", "virtual lte basestation"], "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
