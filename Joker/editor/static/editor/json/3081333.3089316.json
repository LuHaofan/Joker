However, when the applications are deployed in rural areas or poorly-performing networks, the images offloading usually exhausts the limited network resources. While we can certainly revamp the network links, we can also optimize the payload at the same time. In this paper, we propose a middlebox system design that exploits the patterns of similarity between consecutive camera snapshots to alleviate the network load. Our preliminary results show that despite of small errors introduced in the images, the amount of reduced payloads could be a valuable choice to alleviate poorly performing networks.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["camera", "wireless networks"], "location": "Niagara Falls, New York, USA", "series": "MobiSys '17"}
