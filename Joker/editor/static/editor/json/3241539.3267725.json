CEIVE is a victim callee only solution without requiring additional infrastructure support or changes on telephony systems; It is ready to deploy and easy to use. Given an incoming call, CEIVE leverages a callback session and its associated call signaling observed at the phone to infer the call state of the other party. It further compares with the anticipated call state of the incoming call, thus quickly verifying whether the incoming call comes from the originating number or not. In this demo, we demonstrate CEIVE installed on Android phones combating both basic and advanced caller ID spoofing attacks.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["signaling protocols", "mobile networks", "caller ID spoofing attacks"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
