We investigate the downlink throughput of Wi-Fi systems with commercially available 802.11ac products in multiple indoor environments to reveal the throughput of MU-MIMO system that user experiences in practice. From our experiments, Single-User MIMO (SU-MIMO) outperformed MU-MIMO at every experimental environments. We further provide analysis on our experimental results considering channel sounding overhead, user grouping, environmental impact, and transmission mode selection.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["mu-mimo", "user experienced throughput", "802.11ac"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
