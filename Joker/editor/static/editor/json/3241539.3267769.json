This work demonstrates the problem of identifying drivers based on their driving style using smart phones. For this purpose the turns done by the drivers are being studied. Different sensors are embedded in the smart phones which are being used in order to extract some features to distinguish different drivers. Experiments are being done with four drivers and the results show that our system can distinguish them with high accuracy of 92% using only one turn.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["driver identification", "smart sensing", "mobile computing", "driver behavior"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
