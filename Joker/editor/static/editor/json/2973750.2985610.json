Adding new sensing modalities is a cumbersome process because it requires altering the deployed hardware. We introduce passive sensor tags that allow to easily and seamlessly add new sensors to existing IoT deployments without requiring hardware modifications or additional energy sources. Passive sensor tags employ backscatter communication to generate transmissions that can be decoded by the radio transceivers present in today's IoT devices. Furthermore, unlike recent works, our approach does not require dedicated infrastructure to generate the unmodulated carrier used for backscatter communication.The demo showcases our prototype of a passive sensor tag collecting sensor data and delivering it to unmodified commodity IoT devices using passive 802.15.4 transmissions.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["internet of things", "wireless", "backscatter communication"], "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
