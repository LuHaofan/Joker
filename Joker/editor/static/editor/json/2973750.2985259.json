In this paper, we describe our on-going work on measuring and optimizing Android smartwatch energy consumption. We derived power models for commodity smartwatches, and then applied the power model to an IRB-approved user study involving 30 smartwatch users. We then propose research ideas on improving energy efficiencies for Android smartwatches.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["android wear", "energy consumption", "smartwatches"], "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
