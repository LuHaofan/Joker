Such non-flexible thresholding has been introduced mainly due to ED's incapability of differentiating Wi-Fi frames from LTE frames. As a remedy, we design and develop an LAA-LTE transmitter based on a software-defined radio system proposing lightweight but effective Wi-Fi frame detection with which an LAA-LTE device can capture a Wi-Fi preamble by only using LTE's own time-domain samples. Experiments confirm the efficacy of the developed system.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["preamble detection", "Wi-Fi", "LAA-LTE"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
