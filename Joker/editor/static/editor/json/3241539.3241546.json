But such devices barely support any user interaction, even for simple tasks such as menu selection and single-character input. In this paper, we design Inkput, a simple passive interface attached to the unexploited backside of the headset to enable touch sensing. Inkput is a piece of paper substrate with carbon ink patterns printed atop. It leverages the column of electrodes near the edge of the smartphone touchscreen to sense multi-touch on the 2D space, and is even able to locate finger hovering. Our experiments demonstrate that Inkput can precisely detect touch positions with mm-level precision. Our case studies in actual VR applications also verify that Inkput can support common VR interactions and can even outperform high-end handheld controllers in terms of efficiency.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "16", "keywords": ["touch sensing", "mobile virtual reality", "inkjet printing", "vr interaction"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
