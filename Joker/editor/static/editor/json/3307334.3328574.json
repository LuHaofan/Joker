Recovering from severe stress to a normal state is much easier, in terms of the length of time and treatment required, compared to when more serious conditions have manifested [1]. Unfortunately, existing stress monitoring applications either require dedicated applications to be installed on the user's mobile device or use various mobile and wearable sensors [2, 4, 6, 7]; thus are not scalable to large number of users. Our goal is to provide a community-wide \"safety net\" that will automatically and non-intrusively detect individuals exhibiting signs of excessive stress without them installing any dedicated app. YouTube Demo Link https://youtu.be/LKQvIX4W6L0", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["wifi indoor localisation", "mental health", "stress", "machine learning"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
