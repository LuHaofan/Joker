However, most existing IoT devices cannot perform beamforming due to form factor, energy, and cost constraints. This paper presents RFlens, a reconfigurable metasurface that empowers low-profile IoT devices with beamforming capabilities. The metasurface consists of many unit-cells, each acting as a phase shifter for signals going through it. By encoding the phase shifting values, RFlens can manipulate electromagnetic waves to \"reshape\" and resteer the beam pattern. We prototype RFlens for 5 GHz Wi-Fi signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RFlens can achieve a 4.6 dB median signal strength improvement (up to 9.3 dB) even with a relatively small 16 \\texttimes{} 16 array of unit-cells. In addition, RFlens can effectively improve the secrecy capacity of IoT links and enable passive NLoS wireless sensing applications.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 27th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "14"}
