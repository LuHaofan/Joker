However, the key limitation of prior WiFi based gesture recognition systems is that they cannot recognize the gestures of multiple users performing them simultaneously. In this paper, we address this limitation and propose WiMU, a WiFi based Multi-User gesture recognition system. The key idea behind WiMU is that when it detects that some users have performed some gestures simultaneously, it first automatically determines the number of simultaneously performed gestures (Na) and then, using the training samples collected from a single user, generates virtual samples for various plausible combinations of Na gestures. The key property of these virtual samples is that the virtual samples for any given combination of gestures are identical to the real samples that would result from real users performing that combination of gestures. WiMU compares the detected sample against these virtual samples and recognizes the simultaneously performed gestures. We implemented and extensively evaluated WiMU using commodity WiFi devices. Our results show that WiMU recognizes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 simultaneously performed gestures with accuracies of 95.0, 94.6, 93.6, 92.6, and 90.9%, respectively.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 16th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "13", "keywords": ["Gesture recognition", "WiFi", "Multi-user"], "location": "Munich, Germany", "series": "MobiSys '18"}
