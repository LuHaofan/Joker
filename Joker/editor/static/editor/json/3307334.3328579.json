PotholeEye pre-processes the images, extracts features, and classifies the distress into a variety of types, while the road manager is driving. We have tested PotholeEye on real highway involving real settings, a camera, a mini computer, a GPS receiver, and so on, and have shown how we can effectively maintain the pavement distress.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["image processing", "pavement distress", "convolution neural network"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
