Since that offline phase is labor intensive, numerous studies are underway to minimize the effort. In this paper, we present a concept that applies to a collaborative crowdsourcing method. We designed a system that relies on people and robots moving in the indoor space to construct a radio map. Experiments at two testbeds provide proof of the concept and are the result of the last step of the proposed system.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["crowdsourcing", "fingerprint", "radio map", "indoor positioning"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
