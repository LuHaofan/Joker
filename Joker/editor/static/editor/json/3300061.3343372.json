Nevertheless, running heavy 3D Android games on AOVB incurs considerable overhead of full virtualization, thus often leading to unsatisfactory smoothness. To tackle this issue, we present DAOW, a commercial game-oriented Android emulator implementing the idea of direct Android emulation, which eliminates the overhead of full virtualization by providing foreign Android binaries with direct access to the domestic PC hardware through Windows kernel interfaces. In this demo, we will demonstrate that DAOW essentially outperforms traditional AOVB-based emulators in terms of running smoothness, game startup time, and memory usage.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["x86 windows pc", "mobile gaming", "android emulation"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
