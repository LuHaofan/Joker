Previous studies have shown both improvement and degradation in PLT when using h2 with respect to h1 [6, 8]. The disagreement about h2 performance from these studies motivates further investigation as to whether and under what conditions h2 brings the performance benefits that were originally envisioned [5].", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
