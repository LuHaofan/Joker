We designan app running on a smartphone equipped with a time-of-flight sensor that allows efficient, low-cost, and accurate measurement of trunk diameter, even in the face of natural leaf and branch occlusion. The algorithm runs in near real-time on the phone, allowing user interaction to improve the quality of the results. We evaluate the app in realistic settings and find that in a corpus of 55 sample tree images, it estimates trunk diameter with mean error of 7.8%.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "location": "Virtual Event, Wisconsin", "series": "MobiSys '21"}
