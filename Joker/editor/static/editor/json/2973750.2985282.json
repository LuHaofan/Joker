We present the ambiguity problem of the Doppler monitoring system. We find that RSS from a wireless network is complimentary to Doppler signal, and we propose to integrate Doppler with RSS to make respiration monitoring more robust. Our experimental results show that the respiration rate estimation is more accurate by sensor fusion of these two radio frequency (RF) sensing modalities.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["doppler", "wireless network", "radio frequency"], "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
