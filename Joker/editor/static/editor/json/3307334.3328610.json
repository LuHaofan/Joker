In such applications, users can place virtual objects in real-world space, and view them through a camera view. In this work, we develop a framework that supports multi-users interactions for MAR apps, where one user places a virtual object that can be recognized by other users.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["computer version", "augmented reality"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
