We present FollowUs, an easily-deployable (bootstrap-free) and scalable indoor navigation system. In addition to robust navigation through real-time trace-following, FollowUs integrates cloud services to process and combine traces at large scale. It can also leverage optional floor plans to further enhance navigation performance. We designed and implemented FollowUs, including a mobile app and cloud services on Azure, and validate its real-world usability.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["flexibility", "indoor", "cloud", "app", "trace", "scalability", "navigation", "map"], "location": "Snowbird, Utah, USA", "series": "MobiCom '17"}
