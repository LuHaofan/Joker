In this demo, we present FROG, a novel frame rate optimization system for mobile gaming applications. FROG makes use of human visual perception to graphics and regulates application's frame rendering process on-the-fly for maximizing power saving without degrading the user experience. The system works on an existing commercial smartphone and support the legacy gaming applications from app stores without requiring any changes from applications", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["measurement", "frame rate scaling", "experiments"], "location": "Snowbird, Utah, USA", "series": "MobiCom '17"}
