However, there is few vehicular dataset open to study AI assisted self-driving. To make effectively use of AI technologies to optimize self-driving maneuver, we develop an open VeData platform to share the collected datasets. We also develop a Vehicular network Data harvester (VeData), which can collect various vehicular data at an arbitrary frequency. Based on this, we have incrementally collected diversified first-hand data in many different vehicular scenarios, including driving-in-campus, driving-around-campus, driving-in-downtown, and driving-on-highway. More datasets will be collected and shared to promote the research of AI assisted CAVs.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["AI", "dataset", "self-driving", "vehicular network"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
