Social support and CDC have an impact on health behavior and well-being or emotions in couples' dyadic management of diabetes in daily life. Hence, understanding dyadic interactions in-situ in chronic disease management could inform behavioral interventions to help the dyadic management of chronic diseases. It is however not clear how well social support and CDC can be assessed in daily life among couples who are managing chronic diseases. In this ongoing work, we describe the development of DyMand, a novel open-source mobile and wearable system for ambulatory assessment of couples' dyadic management of chronic diseases. Our first prototype is used in the context of diabetes mellitus Type II. Additionally, we briefly describe our experience deploying the prototype in two pre-pilot tests with five subjects and our plans for future deployments.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["chronic disease management", "mobile computing", "wearable computing", "social support", "couples", "mobile health"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
