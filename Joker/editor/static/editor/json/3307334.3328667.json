We evaluate the accuracy of proposed method by comparing with conventional PDR method. As a result, we confirmed that proposed method can estimate the speed more accurately.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["pdr", "deep learning", "location estimation"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
