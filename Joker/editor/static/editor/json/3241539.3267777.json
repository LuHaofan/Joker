Base station sleeping (BSS) techniques has been proposed to reduce the power consumption of the under-utilized base stations (BSs). In this paper, given a partially shared deployment (PSD) of subchannels between macro BS (MBS) and the small cell base stations (SCBSs), the DC uplink (UL) resource allocation problem is formulated. Given such PSD system, the optimum number of subchannels that can be allocated for SCBSs for a DC user in UL are computed. The computation of MBS and SCBSs thresholds for selection of DC user in downlink is also presented. Further, a framework to select the operating point based on energy, throughput, user density, and SCBSs density is presented.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["dual connectivity", "cellular network", "energy efficiency"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
