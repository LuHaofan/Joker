Recent work has investigated the impact of the AP's location on the received signal strength of clients [1], and has shown that a 1:7x throughput improvement can be achieved by simply moving the AP in a 2ft. x 2ft. region. The benefits of small scale AP mobility is chiefly caused by mitigating multipath effects. In fact, the multipath effect has a significant impact on network performance and can be dramatically altered even with mere centimeter level movement of a Tx or a Rx. In this work, we investigate how network throughput performance can be improved if the AP is able to adapt its orientation. We consider two types of orientation changes - that of the AP's base platform (base orientation), and that of its antennas (antenna orientation). We show using experimental analysis that network throughput performance can be improved 1:8x by simply adapting AP's orientation.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["self-positioning AP", "antenna orientation", "base orientation"], "location": "Niagara Falls, New York, USA", "series": "MobiSys '17"}
