In order for WiFi backscatter systems to be practical they should be compatible with existing WiFi networks without any hardware or software modifications. Moreover, they should work with networks that use encryption. In this paper, we present WiTAG which achieves these requirements, making the implementation and deployment of WiFi backscatter communication more practical. In contrast with existing systems which utilize the physical layer for backscatter communication, we take a different approach by leveraging features of the MAC layer to communicate. WiTAG is designed to send data by selectively interfering with subframes (MPDUs) in an aggregated frame (A-MPDU). This enables standard compliant communication using modern, open or encrypted 802.11n and 802.11ac networks without requiring hardware or software modifications to any devices. We implement WiTAG using off-the-shelf components and evaluate its performance in line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight scenarios. We show that WiTAG achieves a throughput of up to 4 Kbps without impacting other devices in the network.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication on the Applications, Technologies, Architectures, and Protocols for Computer Communication", "numpages": "13", "keywords": ["WiFi Backscatter", "Internet of Things (IoT)", "Sensors", "802.11 Networks", "Battery-free communication"], "location": "Virtual Event, USA", "series": "SIGCOMM '20"}
