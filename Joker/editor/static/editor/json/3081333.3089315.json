Our approach focuses on the structure of information flows we gather in our analysis, and the patterns of behavior present in information flows. Our analysis not only gathers simple flows that have a single source and a single sink, but also Multi-Flows that either start from a single source and flow to multiple sinks, or start from multiple sources and flow to a single sink. This analysis captures more complex behavior that both recent malware and recent benign applications exhibit. We leverage N-gram analysis to understand both unique and common behavioral patterns present in Multi-Flows. Our tool leverages N-gram analysis over sequences of API calls that occur along control flow paths in Multi-Flows to precisely analyze Multi-Flows with respect to app behavior.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["information flow analysis", "malware detection", "multi-flow", "security"], "location": "Niagara Falls, New York, USA", "series": "MobiSys '17"}
