The core idea lies in exploiting nonlinearities in microphone hardware with a combination of ultrasound frequencies. These frequencies can be regulated to carry data bits, thereby enabling an acoustic (but inaudible) communication channel to today's microphones. Other applications include jamming spy microphones in the environment, live watermarking of music in a concert, and even acoustic Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["inaudible sound", "acoustic denial of service", "nonlinear acoustic", "security", "privacy", "nonlinearity", "acoustic", "smartphone"], "location": "Niagara Falls, New York, USA", "series": "MobiSys '17"}
