In this paper, we enhance the performance of this process in the wireless network domain. We propose STAteful inter-Packet signaL procEssing (STAPLE), a framework of stateful signal processing residing between the physical and link layers. STAPLE transforms the signal processing procedure into a lightweight stateful process that caches in a small-sized memory table physical and link layer header fields as packet state information. The similarity of such information among packets serves as prior knowledge to further enhance the reliability of signal processing and thus improve the wireless network performance. We implement STAPLE on USRP X300-series devices with adapted configurations for 802.11a/b/g/n/ac and 802.15.4. The STAPLE prototype is of low processing complexity and does not change any wireless standard specification. Comprehensive experimental results show that the benefit from STAPLE is universal in various wireless networks.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "13", "keywords": ["signal processing", "wireless link performance", "estimation and decoding", "wireless networking", "software radio system and protocol"], "location": "Snowbird, Utah, USA", "series": "MobiCom '17"}
