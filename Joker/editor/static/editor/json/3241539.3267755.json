On the other hand, legacy 802.11ac/n links yield much lower rates but are robust even under dynamic scenarios. In this work, we explore using Multipath TCP (MPTCP) to engage both 802.11ad and 802.11ac interfaces simultaneously for performance speed-up and improved reliability. We show that vanilla MPTCP achieves these goals under static conditions but often results in performance worse than using the faster interface alone under dynamic scenarios. We then design and implement AMuSe, a new MPTCP scheduler that allows MPTCP to perform near-optimally under all scenarios.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["WLAN", "802.11ac", "multipath TCP", "802.11ad"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
