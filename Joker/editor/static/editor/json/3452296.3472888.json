Motivated by this, our community is exploring a multitude of solutions for future network stacks: from Linux kernel optimizations to partial hardware offload to clean-slate userspace stacks to specialized host network hardware. The design space explored by these solutions would benefit from a detailed understanding of CPU inefficiencies in existing network stacks.This paper presents measurement and insights for Linux kernel network stack performance for 100Gbps access link bandwidths. Our study reveals that such high bandwidth links, coupled with relatively stagnant technology trends for other host resources (e.g., CPU speeds and capacity, cache sizes, NIC buffer sizes, etc.), mark a fundamental shift in host network stack bottlenecks. For instance, we find that a single core is no longer able to process packets at line rate, with data copy from kernel to application buffers at the receiver becoming the core performance bottleneck. In addition, increase in bandwidth-delay products have outpaced the increase in cache sizes, resulting in inefficient DMA pipeline between the NIC and the CPU. Finally, we find that traditional loosely-coupled design of network stack and CPU schedulers in existing operating systems becomes a limiting factor in scaling network stack performance across cores. Based on insights from our study, we discuss implications to design of future operating systems, network protocols, and host hardware.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGCOMM 2021 Conference", "numpages": "13", "keywords": ["network hardware", "datacenter networks", "host network stacks"], "location": "Virtual Event, USA", "series": "SIGCOMM '21"}
