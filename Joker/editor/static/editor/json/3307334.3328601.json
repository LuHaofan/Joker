Instead of simply analyzing a single input sentence, we consider recent sentences exchanged in a conversation. we performed a user study with 17 participants in 8 groups in a realistic mobile chat environment. Participants spent the least amount of time in identifying and selecting the emojis of their choice with Reeboc (38% faster than without emoji recommendation).", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["machine learning", "mobile applications", "user experience", "emoji recommendation"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
