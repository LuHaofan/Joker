However, to create visual harmony between virtual and physical spaces, the virtual scene must be accurately illuminated with realistic lighting that matches the physical environment. To this end, we design GLEAM, a framework that provides robust illumination estimation in real-time by integrating physical light-probe estimation with current mobile AR systems. We present a demo implementation of GLEAM by means of an AR application that estimates environmental illumination and renders the scene with real-time illumination updates. We demonstrate the efficacy of GLEAM's estimation against a current commercial status quo solution, Apple's ARKit, with the same application.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["image-based lighting", "image processing", "geometry", "augmented reality", "lighting models", "light estimation", "light probe"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
