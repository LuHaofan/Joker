Specifically, we design a set of novel algorithms that can extract the minute infant breathing motion as well as position information from white noise which is random in both the time and frequency domain. Our study demonstrates that the system achieves high correlation between the measured respiratory rate and the ground truth.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["health and wellness", "white noise", "active sonar", "physiological sensing", "computational health", "smart speakers"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
