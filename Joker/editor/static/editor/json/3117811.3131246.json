However, people always divide charging, communicating and sensing apart. In our paper, we put forward a simple but practical method to make use of NFC communication and resonance-type WPT to build up a system which can be used to locate, identify, charge devices while providing a platform for objects to communicate with each other. Our system acts as an intelligent controller, and it links all devices registered to it together to form a scalable network based on common furniture in daily life.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["NFC network", "IoT", "charging network"], "location": "Snowbird, Utah, USA", "series": "MobiCom '17"}
