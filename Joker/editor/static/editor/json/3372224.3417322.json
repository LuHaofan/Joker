We propose and prototype WiChronos, an energy efficient modulation technique for long range wireless communication in a large scale network. Using off-the-shelf (OTS) components, we demonstrate that WiChronos achieves an impressive 60% improvement in battery life compared to state-of-the-art LPWAN technologies at distances over 800 meters. We also show that more than 1000 WiChronos senders co-exist with less than 5% probability of collisions in low traffic conditions.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3"}
