As a result, it is difficult for security manager or attack response systems to understand the alerts and take appropriate actions. In this paper, we describes the analysis of security methods in the area of IoT and describes a mechanism that analyzes logs generated by IoT devices attacks. We models an event network based on a graph of interconnected logs between network devices and IoT gateways. Moreover, suggests an algorithm that correlate logs into single meaningful messages.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["internet of things", "event correlation", "network security", "intrusion detection"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
