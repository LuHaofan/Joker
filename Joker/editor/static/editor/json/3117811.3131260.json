Harnessing available information on geographical position of vehicles and spectrum resources utilization, eNodeBs are capable of allotting the same set of sidelink resources to different vehicles distributed among several communications clusters. Within a communications cluster, it is crucial to prevent time-domain allocation conflicts since vehicles cannot transmit and receive simultaneously, i.e., they must transmit in orthogonal time resources. In this research, we present a solution based on a bipartite graph, where vehicles and spectrum resources are represented by vertices whereas the edges represent the achievable rate in each resource based on the SINR that each vehicle perceives. The aforementioned time orthogonality constraint can be approached by aggregating conflicting vertices into macro-vertices which, in addition, reduces the search complexity. We show mathematically and through simulations that the proposed approach yields an optimal solution. In addition, we provide simulations showing that the proposed method outperforms other competing approaches, specially in scenarios with high vehicular density.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["vehicular communications", "sidelink", "resource allocation"], "location": "Snowbird, Utah, USA", "series": "MobiCom '17"}
