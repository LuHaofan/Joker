In particular, an autonomous vehicle recognizes objects and the surrounding situation using the CNN models. CNN models for image classification are trained using clear image dataset, so they are not robust to grayscale images or noise-intensive data. Therefore, there is a risk of an accident because the quality of the input image drops rapidly during night driving. The region that is revealed by the headlight can have colors, but in the shaded area it has a brightness that is not enough to get color values. We intend to increase the safety of autonomous driving by coloring this region of interest(ROI).", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["computer vision", "mobile gpu", "deep learning"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
