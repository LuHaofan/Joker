However, there are severely challenges to using video codec on mobile devices, because: 1) insufficient computing resources, there is poor performance using mobile device\u202f; 2) the limited battery capacity on mobile device; 3) CPU utilization is too high when using traditional video codec. In this paper, we proposed a GPU based High Definition Parallel Video Codec on mobile devices, which is an efficient video codec with the cooperation of CPU and GPU. The video codec system is fully compliant with the video codec h264 standard. Compared with the scheme using existing X264, the presented experimental results evaluated the GPU based video codec achieves appreciable improvements in FPS(frames per second), the energy consumption and utilization of CPU are reduced properly at the same time.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["mobile device", "GPU", "parallel computing", "motion estimation"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
