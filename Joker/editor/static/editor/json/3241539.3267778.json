Prior work utilize this technology in enabling Gbps wireless links. In contrast, we exploit mmWave technology in designing high-density IoT networks, where there are hundreds of nodes, but each requiring only a Mbps wireless link. However, existing mmWave radios are costly and have high power consumption which makes them unsuitable for IoT sensors. We have built mmPi: a low-cost and low-power mmWave radio that operates as a daughterboard for the Raspberry Pi platform. We believe that mmPi helps advance mmWave research in the IoT domain.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["raspberry pi", "mmWave", "low power", "low cost", "high density", "IoT"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
