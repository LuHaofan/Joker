The system consists of a smart-phone application that computes robust hash of pictures or videos taken from the phone camera, a location attestation service and a public blockchain which contains ledger entries to preserve the evidence file's hash and location certificate. The human witness can remain anonymous in this process. An investigator who receives the evidence (by any means) can verify the integrity and spatio-temporal claims of the evidence by querying the blockchain.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["blockchain application", "digital evidence", "digital forensics", "location security"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
