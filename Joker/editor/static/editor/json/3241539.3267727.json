Small CMOS \"Neurograin\" chips (0.5x0.5 mm2) with on-chip antenna are designed to harvest near-field RF energy at ~1 GHz, and backscatter 10 Mbps BPSK modulated data asynchronously and periodically. A \"Skinpatch\" software-defined radio (SDR) receiver is realized on a commercial USRP running GNU Radio programs. It down-converts the reflected waves from the Neurograins and performs data recovery. In this BMI prototype demonstration, 32 Neurograins will be wirelessly powered, while a Skinpatch USRP will recover their backscattered packets in real-time.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["wireless power transfer", "brain-machine interface", "RF backscatter", "software-defined radio", "implantable sensors"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
