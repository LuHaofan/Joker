Collecting large volumes of typing data is also easy on smartphones. This motivates the use of Deep Neural Network (DNN) to determine emotion states from smartphone typing. In this work, we developed a DNN model based on typing features to predict four emotion states (happy, sad, stressed, relaxed) and investigate its performance on a smartphone. The evaluation of the model in a 3-week study with 15 participants reveals that it can reliably detect emotions with an average accuracy of 80% with peak CPU utilization less than 15%.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["emotion detection", "deep neural network", "typing", "smartphone"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
