Such practices, albeit innovative and effective, require well-controlled alignment of camera and screen and obstacle-free access. In this demo, we present Dolphin, a novel form of real-time acoustics-based dual-channel communication, which uses a speaker and the microphones on off-the-shelf smartphones to achieve concurrent audible and hidden communication. By leveraging masking effects of the human auditory system and readily available audio signals in our daily lives, Dolphin ensures real-time unobtrusive speaker-microphone data communication, while, at the same time, it overcomes the main limitations of existing screen-camera links.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["dual-mode communication", "hidden audible communication", "speaker-microphone communication"], "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
