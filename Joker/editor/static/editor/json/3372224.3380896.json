Existing electric toothbrushing monitoring systems fail to detect these issues because they cannot achieve fine-grained position tracking. In this paper, we present a novel electric toothbrushing monitoring system called MET that tracks brushing coverage for all the 15 surfaces of teeth and detects different types of incorrect brushing techniques. This design is inspired by our observation that the motor inside an electric toothbrush generates a unique magnetic field, which can serve as a reliable signal for position and orientation tracking. MET is the first system that tracks both the position and orientation of an unmodified electric motor using magnetic inductive sensing. Experiments with fourteen users show that the average toothbrushing surface recognition accuracy of MET is 85.3%. Moreover, MET is robust to user location changes and posture variations and does not require any training from the users. Experimental results also demonstrate our significant advantages over existing commercial systems.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "14"}
