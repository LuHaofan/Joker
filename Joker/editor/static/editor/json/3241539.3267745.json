Most of the current IoT system are specific and non-programmable and therefore their slices are difficult to reuse. It is difficult to meet different QoS requirements especially in IoT system because there are plenty of IoT sensors in IoT system. In this paper, we propose a novel IoT network slicing creation system which based on two emerging SDN and NFV technologies. It provides an easily-operating service creation environment and a service execution environment based on micro service architecture. We implement an IoT muti-flow transmission scenario. After adding subservices and QoS policies into a business process at the design plane, the IoT scenario can run automatically at the execution plane. Experiment results on the scenario show that the numbers of packets per second of different flows are changing gradually depend on QoS policies.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["IoT", "SDN", "NFV", "network slices", "5G"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
