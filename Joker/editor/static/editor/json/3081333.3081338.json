Instead of proposing modifications to existing home hubs, we build an independent embedded system that connects to a home hub via its audio input. Considering the aesthetics of home hubs, we envision SoundSifter as a smart sleeve or a cover for these devices. SoundSifter has hardware and software to capture the audio, isolate signals from distinct sound sources, filter out signals that are from unwanted sources, and process the signals to enforce policies such as personalization before the signals enter into an untrusted system like Amazon Echo or Google Home. We conduct empirical and real-world experiments to demonstrate that SoundSifter runs in real-time, is noise resilient, and supports selective and personalized voice commands that commercial voice-enabled home hubs do not.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "13", "keywords": ["audio privacy", "sound source separation", "acoustic sensing"], "location": "Niagara Falls, New York, USA", "series": "MobiSys '17"}
