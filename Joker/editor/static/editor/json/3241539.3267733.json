However, how to motivate people to collect and share data is a challenge. We believe the major reason why many MCS systems are not pervasive is because there are no incentives for people to use them. In this paper, we present SensingGO, a system which encourages people to keep sensing data by integrating incentive mechanisms. The sensed data are then transmitted to our backend server. The data we collected and the source code of SensingGO are open to anyone freely. We also demonstrate the analysis of real mobile data collected from SensingGO.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["mobile crowd sensing", "mobile applications and services"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
