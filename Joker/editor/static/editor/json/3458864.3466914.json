A string of work has appeared recently, proposing to offload a part of the AR-related processing pipeline to the edge [8]. One pitfall in these studies is the (simplified) assumption about the network delay. As a reality check and to gather insights to realize AR in real time, we seek in this work a better understanding of how a popular AR game, Pok\\'{e}mon Go, delivers its data in situ.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["traffic characterization", "AR game", "edge offloading"], "location": "Virtual Event, Wisconsin", "series": "MobiSys '21"}
