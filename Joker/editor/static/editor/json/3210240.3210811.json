We propose a concept and a prototype to enhance human-object interactions in daily life with 3D audio. We augment real objects in a small workspace around the user with spatial audio notifications.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 16th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "location": "Munich, Germany", "series": "MobiSys '18"}
