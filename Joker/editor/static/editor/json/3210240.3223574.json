We identify key properties and challenges to learning on harvested energy which relates to the semantics of machine learning tasks. Each of these challenges leads to a new research direction. We envision that a big chunk of research on batteryless IoT devices in the next 5-10 years will be about making them capable of continuously learning throughout their lifetime. Concepts related to intermittent learning will be at the heart of those works.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 16th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["lifelong learning", "energy harvester", "intermittent learning"], "location": "Munich, Germany", "series": "MobiSys '18"}
