However, existing works use only the coarse-grained packet-level information for cross-technology modulation, suffering from a low throughput (e.g., 10bps). Our approach, called BlueBee, aims at achieving much higher CTC throughput thus extends CTC applications. We pro- poses a new direction by emulating legitimate ZigBee frames using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio. Uniquely, BlueBee achieves dual-standard compliance (i.e., BLE and ZigBee) and transparency by selecting only the payload of Bluetooth frames, requiring neither hardware nor firmware changes at the BLE senders and ZigBee receivers. Our implementation on commodity device testbeds shows that BlueBee can achieve a more than 99% accuracy and a through- put 10,000x faster than the state-of-the-art CTC reported so far. In addition, we show a demo of using BlueBee on a smartphone to control several smart light bulbs a ached with ZigBee radio.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["bluetooth low energy", "signal emulation", "internet of things", "zigbee", "cross technology communication"], "location": "Snowbird, Utah, USA", "series": "MobiCom '17"}
