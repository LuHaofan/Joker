And even when they are available, understanding why a CCA underperforms by trawling through massive amounts of statistical data from network connections is challenging. The history of congestion control is replete with many examples of surprising and unanticipated behaviors unseen in simulation but observed on real-world paths. In this paper, we propose initial steps toward modeling and improving our confidence in a CCA's behavior. We have developed CCAC, a tool that uses formal verification to establish certain properties of CCAs. It is able to prove hypotheses about CCAs or generate counterexamples for invalid hypotheses. With CCAC, a designer can not only gain greater confidence prior to deployment to avoid unpleasant surprises, but can also use the counterexamples to iteratively improvetheir algorithm. We have modeled additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease (AIMD), Copa, and BBR with CCAC, and describe some surprising results from the exercise.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGCOMM 2021 Conference", "numpages": "16", "keywords": ["formal verification", "congestion control", "WAN transport"], "location": "Virtual Event, USA", "series": "SIGCOMM '21"}
