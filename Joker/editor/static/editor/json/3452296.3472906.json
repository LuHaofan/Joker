Addition of new carriers requires the network operators to accurately configure their parameters for the desired behaviors. This is a challenging problem because of the large number of parameters related to various functions like user mobility, interference management and load balancing. Furthermore, the same parameters can have varying values across different locations to manage user and traffic behaviors as planned and respond appropriately to different signal propagation patterns and interference. Manual configuration is time-consuming, tedious and error-prone, which could result in poor quality of service. In this paper, we propose a new data-driven recommendation approach Auric to automatically and accurately generate configuration parameters for new carriers added in cellular networks. Our approach incorporates new algorithms based on collaborative filtering and geographical proximity to automatically determine similarity across existing carriers. We conduct a thorough evaluation using real-world LTE network data and observe a high accuracy (96%) across a large number of carriers and configuration parameters. We also share experiences from our deployment and use of Auric in production environments.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGCOMM 2021 Conference", "numpages": "14", "keywords": ["cellular network configuration", "collaborative filtering", "recommendation algorithms", "carrier addition"], "location": "Virtual Event, USA", "series": "SIGCOMM '21"}
