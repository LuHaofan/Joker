The onset or progression of diseases like obesity, diabetes, and metabolic disorder are strongly related to eating behavior, and scientists are still trying to fully understand the complex mixture of diet, exercise, genetics, sociocultural context, and physical environment that lead to these diseases. Health science, however, has no effective means for automatically measuring eating behavior in free-living conditions. The Auracle aims to be a wearable earpiece that detects eating behavior, to be fielded by health-science researchers in their efforts to study eating behavior and ultimately to develop interventions useful to individuals striving to address chronic disease related to eating.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "location": "Niagara Falls, New York, USA", "series": "MobiSys '17"}
