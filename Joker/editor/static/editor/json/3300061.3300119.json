To mitigate this privacy threat, we have developed HideScreen by utilizing the human vision and optical system properties to hide the users' on-screen information from the shoulder surfers.Specifically, HideScreen discretizes the device screen into grid patterns to neutralize the low-frequency components so that the on-screen information will \"blend into'' the background when viewed from the outside of the designed range. We have developed and evaluated several ways of hiding both on-screen texts and images from shoulder surfers. Our extensive experimental evaluation of HideScreen demonstrates its high protection rates (&gt;96% for texts and &gt;99% for images) while providing good user experience.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "16", "keywords": ["shoulder surfing", "mobile privacy", "privacy protection", "human machine interaction"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
