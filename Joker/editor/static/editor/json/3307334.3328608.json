Though many smart speakers have appeared in the market, we do not know the exact performance of smart speakers. In particular, when we call a smart speaker to issue a voice command, we recognize that the smart speaker is ready when it turns its LED lamps on. The wake-up response time is important for improving user experience. Therefore, we have to measure the wake-up response time, which requires the video analysis of smart speaker LED's status for the voice command. In this work, we present a smart speaker wake-up response time measurement method with a camera. We record video files with camera while testing a smart speaker and analyze image similarity to find a wake-up event. For this purpose, we use the Google Inception-v3 model to improve the accuracy of detecting the image change of a small area.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["smart speaker", "transfer learning", "wake-up response time", "measurements"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
