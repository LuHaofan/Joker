Telco operators will be able to truly bring intelligence to the network, dynamically deploying and adapting its elements at run time according to current conditions and traffic demands. Deploying intelligent solutions for softwarized NextG networks, however, requires extensive prototyping and testing procedures, currently largely unavailable. To this aim, this paper introduces SCOPE, an open and softwarized prototyping platform for NextG systems. SCOPE is made up of: (i) A ready-to-use, portable open-source container for instantiating softwarized and programmable cellular network elements (e.g., base stations and users); (ii) an emulation module for diverse real-world deployments, channels and traffic conditions for testing new solutions; (iii) a data collection module for artificial intelligence and machine learning-based applications, and (iv) a set of open APIs for users to control network element functionalities in real time. Researchers can use SCOPE to test and validate NextG solutions over a variety of large-scale scenarios before implementing them on commercial infrastructures. We demonstrate the capabilities of SCOPE and its platform independence by prototyping exemplary cellular solutions in the controlled environment of Colosseum, the world's largest wireless network emulator. We then port these solutions to indoor and outdoor testbeds, namely, to Arena and POWDER, a PAWR platform.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "12", "keywords": ["data-driven control", "network slicing", "NextG", "data collection", "5G"], "location": "Virtual Event, Wisconsin", "series": "MobiSys '21"}
