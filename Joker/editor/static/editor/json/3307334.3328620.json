Bluetooth specification 4.2 defined only one data rate, 1 Mb/s. However, Bluetooth specification 5 released in 2016 specifies 2 Mb/s and coded PHY for higher throughput and for more stable transmission, respectively. In addition, this version of specification defines transmission power from -20 dBm to 20 dBm. In this paper, we propose AdaptaBLE, an algorithm that selects the data rate and transmission power of BLE by considering link stability and energy consumption. We implement AdaptaBLE on real devices and measure its performance. As a result, we confirm that AdaptaBLE successfully lowers energy consumption while keeping the link stable.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["rate adaptation", "bluetooth low energy", "power adaptation"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
