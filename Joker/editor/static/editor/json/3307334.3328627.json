Environmental and agricultural networks may not have existing internet backhauls for data delivery due to low population densities in rural areas, making UASs a potential data delivery alternative. UASs can be deployed as aerial network relay nodes [1, 2, 3, 4] or as data mules [5, 6]. In addition to mending network fragmentation, UAS applications include post-disaster data collection involving inoperative communication infrastructure [7, 8, 9], supplementing existing communication in- frastructure for vehicular networks [10], and rural applications in environmental monitoring [11, 12] and precision agriculture [13, 14].", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["sensor network", "wireless networks", "uas", "experimental measurements", "internet of things", "aerial networks", "drone", "uav", "802.15.4"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
