Recent studies tend to deploy Network Function Virtualization (NFV) services to MEC. Network services in NFV are deployed as Service Function Chains (SFCs). In this paper, we mainly focus on the SFC placement problem in a MEC-NFV environment, which is different from the data center network. Firstly, we formulate this problem as a weighted graph matching problem consisting of graph matching and SFC mapping. Then, we propose a linear programming-based approach to match the edge network and SFC. Finally, we design a Hungarian-based placement algorithm to map SFC in the edge network. A heuristic-based greedy algorithm is also designed to compare the performance. Evaluation results show that our proposed solutions outperform the greedy algorithm in terms of execution time.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["placement", "linear programming", "sfc", "mec", "nfv"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
