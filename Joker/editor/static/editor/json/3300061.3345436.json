To achieve this long range, we use the transmitter as an RF power source that can be on or off if it does or does not send a packet, respectively, and a receiver that repeatedly measures the noise and interference power level. We use spread spectrum techniques on top of the basic on/off mechanism to overcome the interference caused by other devices' channel access to provide long ranges at a much lower data rate. We implement the protocol on top of commodity WiFi hardware. We discuss our design and how we overcome key challenges such as non-stationary interference, carrier sensing and hardware timing delays. We test ONPC in several situations to show that it achieves significantly longer range than standard WiFi.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "14", "keywords": ["long-range communication", "internet of things", "wifi", "wireless communication"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
