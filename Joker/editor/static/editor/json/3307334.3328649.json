Example applications are augmented reality Head-Up-Display in a connected car [2], scout drone that chases a target suspect among the crowd [3], autonomous fleet drones [1], and so on. These futuristic applications in various genres of devices are latency-sensitive and require a significant computation power to process a tremendous amount of data from built-in sensors [8]. However, the capabilities of processors shipped with these devices are limited. A natural solution is offloading to an edge surrogate,1 running on a 'nearby' edge-cloud that offers more computation capacity at low latency.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["fast-moving devices", "proactive provisioning", "edge provisioning", "edge node prediction"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
