However, the dependencies for a large range of hardware devices need to be addressed before realizing emergency live migration. Our platform introduces container-based light virtualization and an automated build function to isolate an application so that it can be deployed on different devices such as Edison, Raspberry Pi model B, BeagleBone Black, and Odroid XU3.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["live migration", "container", "virtualization", "system resilience"], "location": "Niagara Falls, New York, USA", "series": "MobiSys '17"}
