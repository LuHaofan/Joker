In this work, we uncover three vulnerabilities of the current SIM practice. We show that the PIN-based access control may expose the in-SIM data to an adversary through both hardware and software. Once exposed, such in-SIM information can be used to reconstruct various keys used for device authentication, data encryption, etc. They thus enable a number of attacks, including traffic eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attack, impersonation, etc. The fundamental problem is that, the current SIM design does not offer proper authentication and fine-grained access control to hundreds of in-SIM files for various in-card applets and off-card units. We next propose a new solution that offers both authentication and fine-grained access control. Our implementation and evaluation have confirmed the viability of our proposal.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 27th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "14"}
