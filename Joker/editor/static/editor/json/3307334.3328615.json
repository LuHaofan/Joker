Our new prototype allows for large area acoustic sensing using modular fabrication techniques with the promise of being fully printable. A single small Surface++ patch can be used to extend voice and gesture input for everyday surfaces, while our more sensitive Surface++ modular array allows for large-area context sensing and localization.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["sound", "low-power", "interaction and control", "backscatter communication", "triboelectric nanogenerator", "self-sustainable", "acoustic localization", "vibration", "sensing", "flexible electronics"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
