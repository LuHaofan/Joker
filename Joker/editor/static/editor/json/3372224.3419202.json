Previous approaches either work in an intrusive manner or fail to capture the micrometer-level vibrations. In this work, we propose mmVib, a practical approach to measure micrometer-level vibrations with mmWave radar. By introducing a Multi-Signal Consolidation (MSC) model to describe the properties of the reflected signals, we exploit the inherent consistency among those signals to accurately recover the vibration characteristics. We implement a prototype of mmVib, and the experiments show that this design achieves 8.2% relative amplitude error and 0.5% relative frequency error in median. Typically, the median amplitude error is 3.4um for the 100um-amplitude vibration. Compared to two existing approaches, mmVib reduces the 80th-percentile amplitude error by 62.9% and 68.9% respectively.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "13"}
