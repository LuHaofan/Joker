Road conditions in developing countries like India are chaotic where roads are not well maintained and thus vehicular sensors alone do not suffice in detecting impending collisions. In this paper, we investigate a collaborative driver assistance system \"DRIZY: DRIve eaSY\" for such scenarios where inference is drawn from on-board camera feed to alert drivers of obstacles ahead and the cloud uses GPS sensor data uploaded by all vehicles to alert drivers of vehicles in potential collision trajectory. Thus, we combine computer vision and vehicle-to-cloud communication to create comprehensive situational awareness. We prototype our system to consider two types of collisions: vehicle-to-vehicle collisions based on uploading GPS sensor data of vehicles to cloud and vehicle-to-pedestrian collisions based on detecting pedestrians from vehicle's dashboard camera feed. Sensor data processing in each vehicle occurs on smartphone for GPS values which are then uploaded to cloud and on raspberry pi3 for video feeds to make a cost-effective solution. Experiments over both 4G and wireless networks in India show that collaborative driver assistance is feasible in low traffic density within acceptable driver reaction time of &lt;5 sec, but can be limited by the time to process compute-intensive video feeds in real-time. We investigate novel ways to optimize the processing to find an acceptable trade-off.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["HOG+SVM sliding-window optimization", "pedestrian detection", "edge computing", "vehicle-to-cloud communication", "driver assistance system"], "location": "Snowbird, Utah, USA", "series": "MobiCom '17"}
