SolarGest is based on the observation that each gesture interferes with incident light rays on the solar panel in a unique way, leaving its distinguishable signature in harvested photocurrent. Using solar energy harvesting laws, we develop a model to optimize design and usage of SolarGest. To further improve the robustness of SolarGest under non-deterministic operating conditions, we combine dynamic time warping with Z-score transformation in a signal processing pipeline to pre-process each gesture waveform before it is analyzed for classification. We evaluate SolarGest with both conventional opaque solar cells as well as emerging see-through transparent cells. Our experiments with 6,960 gesture samples for 6 different gestures reveal that even with transparent cells, SolarGest can detect 96% of the gestures while consuming 44% less power compared to light sensor based systems.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "15", "keywords": ["light-based sensing", "transparent solar cell", "gesture recognition"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
