In the process, they waste their energy and airtime, which affects their battery-life and throughput. We present Elixir, a protocol for WiFi-based IoT nodes that enables them to transmit data without the need of a WiFi association. Elixir is implemented in the user space, which makes it easy to port the implementation to any Linux-based client and AP. We demonstrate its end-to-end operation on a Raspberry Pi module in good [signal strengths '40 to '50 dBm and no losses] and bad network conditions [signal strengths below '80 dBm and losses present]. We measure benefits of Elixir in terms of (a) the ability to transmit when the WiFi association cannot be maintained [in bad network condition], (b) lesser number of frames transmitted [50x - good network condition, 100x\u202f? bad network condition], (c) reduced airtime consumption [10x - bad network condition], and (d) reduced battery expenditure [18% for both network conditions].", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["probe stuffing", "association-free communication", "IEEE 802.11"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
