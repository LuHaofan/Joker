However, there is a sense of urgency now in understanding and preventing concussions better, due to raising public awareness. Towards that end, intra-oral devices such as Vector MouthGuards are being studied [3] to measure the athlete's head's linear and rotational accelerations from impacts experienced in practices and games. But given the players' natural distaste for such intra-oral devices, more palatable alternatives for head impact monitoring are being developed [2]. X2 Biosystems xPatchis an electronic skin patch thatis worn behind the ear. Reebok Checklight embeds the impact sensor in the back of a skullcap which can be worn with or without a helmet. Triax SIM-P is placed inside a headband for non-helmeted sports and a skullcap for helmeted sports. While all these devices are much more convenient to wear than intra-oral devices, it is yet to be seen whether they gain wider acceptance, particularly by the millions of amateur soccer players all over the world.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["concussion", "soccer", "header impact", "smartball", "accelerometer"], "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
