How to reduce the power consumption of mobile devices with limited energy has become a research hotspot. We propose an energy-efficient architecture that includes smartphones' various power saving solutions for video transmission over wireless networks. Results demonstrate that each of our proposed solutions is significantly outperforms than the standard scheme.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["iot applications", "energy efficient", "mobile video transmission"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
