With ProDroid, developers can create a new app that imports various kinds of functionality provided by other existing Android apps. Our evaluation shows that with the help of ProDroid, a developer was able to import a function from an existing Android app into a new prototype with only 55 lines of Java code, while the function itself requires 10,334 lines of Java code to implement.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["android", "development frameworks", "functional prototyping"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
