In this paper, we present MuVIS, a novel framework that proposes MU-MIMO-aware optimization for multi-user multimedia applications over IEEE 802.11ac/ax. Taking a cross-layer approach, MuVIS first optimizes the MU-MIMO user group selection for the users with the same characteristics in the PHY/MAC layer. It then optimizes the video bitrate for each group accordingly. We present our design and its evaluation on smartphones and laptops over 802.11ac WiFi.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 27th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3"}
