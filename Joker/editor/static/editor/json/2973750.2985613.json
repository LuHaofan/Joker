In this work, we introduce Tagyro, which attaches an array of passive RFID tags as orientation sensors on everyday objects. Tagyro uses a closed-form model to transform the run-time phase offsets between tags into orientation angle, and addresses the unexpected deviation of phase measurement distorted by imperfect radiation pattern of practical tags. We have implemented a real-time version of Tagyro on a commodity RFID system. In this demo, we show that Tagyro can handle the phase distortion by sensing the effective layout tag array, an use the sensed layout to track the orientation of objects in high accuracy.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["tag array", "RFID", "orientation tracking", "internet-of-things"], "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
