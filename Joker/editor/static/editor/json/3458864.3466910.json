By design, WebAssembly is considered as the first-class citizen in ThingSpire OS to achieve coherent execution among IoT device, edge and cloud. Furthermore, ThingSpire OS enables efficient execution of WebAssembly on resource-constrained devices by implementing a WebAssembly runtime based on Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilation with a small footprint, achieves seamless inter-module communication wherever the modules locate, and leverages several optimizations such as lightweight preemptible invocation for memory isolation and control-flow integrity. We implement a prototype of ThingSpire OS and conduct preliminary evaluations on its inter-module communication performance.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["operating system", "WebAssembly", "internet of things"], "location": "Virtual Event, Wisconsin", "series": "MobiSys '21"}
