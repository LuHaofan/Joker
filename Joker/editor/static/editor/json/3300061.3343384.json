To protect sensitive on-screen information, we have developed HideScreen by utilizing the human vision and optical system properties to hide the users' on-screen information from the shoulder surfers.Specifically, HideScreen discretizes the on-screen information (OSI) into grid patterns to neutralize the low-frequency components so that the OSI will \"blend into\" the background when viewed from the outside of the designed range. We have developed and evaluated several ways of hiding both on-screen texts and images from shoulder surfers. Our extensive experimental evaluation of HideScreen has demonstrated its high protection rates (&gt;96% for texts and &gt;99% for images) while providing good user experience.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["shoulder surfing", "privacy protection", "mobile privacy", "human machine interaction"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
