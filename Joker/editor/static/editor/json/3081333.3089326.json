However, sharing user's sensitive information with the ad servers may raise privacy concerns. As opposed to targeting users, mobile contextual advertising seeks to target the app page a user is viewing. In this demo, we present a novel mobile contextual advertising platform, called MoCA, which is designed to improve the semantic relevance of in-app ads in a stand-alone, privacy-protecting manner on mobile devices. MoCA understands the semantics of app page and ads, and then matches semantically relevant ads to the page inside mobile devices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to implement the mobile contextual advertising platform based on the semantic approach without resort to ad servers.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["in-app advertising", "tiny text intelligence", "mobile contextual advertising"], "location": "Niagara Falls, New York, USA", "series": "MobiSys '17"}
