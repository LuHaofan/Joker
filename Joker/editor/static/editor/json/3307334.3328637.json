In WLAN, using a central controller for resource sharing and management is a common practice in mid-size and large-size network. However, in case of small businesses (i.e., restaurants, coffee shops, etc.), business owners cannot afford to obtain the controller. To realize the bandwidth sharing among Access Points (AP) in a distribute manner, seamless handoff of mobile devices (i.e., smartphones and tablets) between small-business owned Access Points (APs) via association control and maintain stable TCP connection are essential but quite challenging. This poster proposes a novel way to cooperatively share wireless resources among the APs. This includes an efficient association control between stations and APs, dedicated virtual access point per station, and tunneling support maintaining existing TCP connection after relocation to another AP.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["distribued network", "virtual access point", "wifi", "wireless network"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
