It provides a general way to alter functionality of platform APIs on Android. With Reptor, third-party developers can modify the behavior of platform APIs according to their needs. All modifications are completely at the app layer without modifying the underlying platform. This allows practical openness---third-party developers can easily distribute their modifications for a platform without the need to update the entire platform.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["API virtualization", "android platform instrumentation", "android app instrumentation", "platform openness"], "location": "Niagara Falls, New York, USA", "series": "MobiSys '17"}
