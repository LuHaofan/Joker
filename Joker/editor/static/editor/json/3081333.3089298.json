In our recent measurement study involving 27 smartwatch users [1], we found that push notifications are used by more than 200 applications, dominated by instant messaging, emails, social media, etc. In this work, we propose a suite of methods to optimize the performance, energy efficiency, and usability of smartwatch push notifications, which have several salient features distinguishing them from regular notifications received on a smartphone: requiring heavy phonewatch cooperation, being delivered over short-range Bluetooth link, and incurring non-trivial energy consumption on watches with very limited battery capacity. Considering these factors, our proposed work focuses on four aspects as elaborated.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["smartwatch", "push notification"], "location": "Niagara Falls, New York, USA", "series": "MobiSys '17"}
