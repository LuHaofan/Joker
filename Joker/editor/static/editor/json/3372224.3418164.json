In the proposed system, user privacy protection (on device, edge, and cloud) is implemented via the design of multiple levels of data sensitivity protection: User activities and location data are anonymized, consented, and aggregated (via edge computing at public infrastructures) before uploading for analysis; Specially designed event tokens are distributed for information/notification flowing and matching, and sharing user sensitive data is avoided; Event tokens also link hierarchical user groups combined with blockchain based technologies. Our system facilitates matching between user private data and public data without compromising privacy.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3"}
