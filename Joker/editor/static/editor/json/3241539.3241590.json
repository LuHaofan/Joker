Of late, we are seeing a huge excitement about applying AI and ML to networked systems. Is this merely a hype? Are there use cases and genuine applications that could lead to real deployment and practical solutions? What are the key challenges in applying AI and ML to networked systems? Can researchers and practitioners in communication networks and networked systems tap into machine learning and AI techniques to optimize network architecture, control and management, leading to increased automation in network operations? Can researchers and practitioners in the AI community explore synergy with networking researchers to optimize network architecture and design? The above are some of the questions that would be addressed during the panel discussion. The objective of the panel discussion would be to tap the minds of the global experts in order to understand the merits and limitations and the future landscape in the intersection of networking/networked systems and AI/ML.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["communication networks", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
