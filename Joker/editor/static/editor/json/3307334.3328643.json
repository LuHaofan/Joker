However in the fifth generation (5G), supported by Software Defined Network (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV), network slicing technology [1] makes mobile networks more intelligent and flexible. 5G network slicing allows a set of logically independent virtual networks to be created on a common physical infrastructure and provides appropriate monitoring, management and resource allocation for a variety of different types of communication services [2].", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["network slicing", "template", "network interface", "network function virtualization"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
