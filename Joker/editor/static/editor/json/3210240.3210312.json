It helps developers quickly realize their ideas by using a high-level Matlab script, and test them on various OS platforms, such as Android, iOS, Tizen, and Linux/Win. LibAS simplifies the development of acoustic sensing apps by hiding the platform-dependent details. For example, developers need not learn Objective-C/SWIFT or the audio buffer management in the CoreAudio framework when they want to implement acoustic sensing algorithms on an iPhone. Instead, developers only need to decide on the sensing signals and the callback function to handle each repetition of sensing signals. We have implemented apps covering three major acoustic sensing categories to demonstrate the benefits and simplicity of developing apps with LibAS. Our evaluation results show the adaptability of LibAS in supporting various acoustic sensing apps and tuning/improving their performance efficiently. Developers have reported that LibAS saves them a significant amount of time/effort and can reduce up to 90% lines of code in their acoustic sensing apps.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 16th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "13", "keywords": ["Acoustic sensing", "cross-platform development", "rapid prototype"], "location": "Munich, Germany", "series": "MobiSys '18"}
