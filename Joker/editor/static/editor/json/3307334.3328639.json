In 2018, the goal of the Grand Challenge was to make predictions for vessels' destinations and arrival times. In our previous work [3], as a participant of the Grand Challenge, we adopted a grid-based Bayesian inference model to yield a decent result. However, we found that a number of serious outliers in the real-world data may adversely affect predictions. This paper introduces our attempts to enhance the performance of the previous model for predicting the destination and arrival time of a vessel issued by ACM DEBS GC 2018, by proposing an outlier detection method based on clustering and refning training data.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["ship trajectory", "outlier detection", "trajectory clustering"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
