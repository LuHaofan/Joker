Due to their true 3D nature, streaming volumetric videos is highly bandwidth demanding. In this work, we present to our knowledge a first volumetric video streaming system that leverages deep super resolution (SR) to boost the video quality on commodity mobile devices. We propose a series of judicious optimizations to make SR efficient on mobile devices.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "location": "Toronto, Ontario, Canada", "series": "MobiSys '20"}
