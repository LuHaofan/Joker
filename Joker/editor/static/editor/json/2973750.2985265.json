When users move across different locations, their service applications often need to be migrated to follow the user so that the benefit of MEC is maintained. In this paper, we propose a layered framework for migrating running applications that are encapsulated either in virtual machines (VMs) or containers. We evaluate the migration performance of various real applications under the proposed framework.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["edge computing", "service migration", "cloudlet", "containers"], "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
