To tap-in the gold-mine of data generated by IoT devices with unprecedented volume and value, we discover and leverage the hidden connections among the multimodal data collected by various sensing devices. Different modal data can complete and learn from each other, but it is challenging to fuse multimodal data without knowing their perception (and thus the correct labels). In this work, we propose MultiSense, a paradigm for automatically mining potential perception, cross-labelling each modal data, and then improving the learning models over the set of multimodal data. We design innovative solutions for segmenting, aligning, and fusing multimodal data from different sensors. We implement our framework and conduct comprehensive evaluations on a rich set of data. Our results demonstrate that MultiSense significantly improves the data usability and the power of the learning models.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["multinodal data", "cross labelling", "cross learning"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
