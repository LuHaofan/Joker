We demonstrate tinySDR which is a low-power software-defined radio platform tailored to the needs of IoT endpoints. TinySDR is a standalone, fully programmable software-defined radio platform which has the requirements of IoT protocols. We present the physical layer implementations of BLE beacon and LoRa protocols to demonstrate the capabilities of tinySDR.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["low-power", "software-defined radio", "iot", "radio platform"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
