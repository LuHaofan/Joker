Electricity grids are increasingly transforming from the one-directional way of generating, transmitting, and distributing electricity to smart grids that are multi-directional in the way they monitor, automate, and remotely operate the power sector. SCADA systems are increasingly under cyber attacks illustrating growing vulnerabilities to the smart grids. The U.S. power industry notes the importance of SCADA chain cyber risks and the need to take proactive measures (timely patching of vulnerabilities) to mitigate the risks. However, not all vulnerabilities are always exploited by attackers; and not all vulnerabilities can be patched in resource-constrained scenarios. Therefore, the patch sequence needs to be strategic and efficient.In this poster, we address the critical need to prioritize patching the smart grid SCADA systems on time. This is even more prominent with the advent of new technologies, usage of backup systems, updated standards, and new regulations on the safety and security of the smart grid. In this direction, we present SmartPatch - a patch prioritization method to address patch sequencing of the SCADA chain in the smart grid systems. It analyzes the possible attacker behavior as well as system criticality using game theory for decision making. It provides a patch prioritization strategy that is cost-constrained and reduces the impact of the possible attacks to a large extent.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3"}
