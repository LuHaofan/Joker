Yet, specialized hardware remains the preferred implementation choice for the wireless physical layer. This is primarily due to the tight latency requirements and high bandwidth demanded by operations at the wireless PHY, as opposed to the network-layer. This poster argues that in the era of low-power Internet of Things, virtualization of physical layer functions deserves a revisit. We specifically study low-power Internet of Things technologies that present a ripe opportunity for cloudification of wireless network functions, with their lower bandwidths and lax latency constraints. We present our vision of how physical layer function virtualization should be structured to maximize benefits and performance. We present a feasibility study on the latency and scalability limits of such virtualization for various physical layer functions that could leverage such an architecture.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["network function virtualization", "wireless network functions", "physical layer", "software-defined networking"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
