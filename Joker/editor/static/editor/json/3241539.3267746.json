We in this paper propose an alternative modality for obtaining mobility context using smartphone keyboard interaction patterns using a personalized framework. Experimental results show that the framework can predict the mobility context at an average F1 score (both micro and macro) greater than 0.6 across all subjects.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["typing patterns", "side-channel attacks", "user context"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
