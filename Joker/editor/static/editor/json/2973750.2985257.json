We envision a LED-to-smartphone VLC protocol for delivering messages to a group of unsynchronized mobile device receivers. We carefully design and implement our protocol, Martian, which allows smooth communication from the LED lights to a group of camera-enabled mobile devices. Across several phone models, Martian can achieve data rate of about 1.6kbps even with NLOS-light. Our intensive evaluations indicate that, the data rate reaches 4.2kbps on iPhone 6. This is a significant improvement compared with the 88bps data rate claimed by state-of-art design.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["heterogeneous", "LED", "visible light communication", "smartphone"], "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
