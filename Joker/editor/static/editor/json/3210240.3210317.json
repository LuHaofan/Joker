Our approach does not require tampering or installing software on the victim's device, or specialized hardware. The app is demonstrated by attacking keystroke dynamics, a method leveraging the unique typing behaviour of users to authenticate them on a smartphone, which was previously thought to be hard to mimic. In addition, we propose a low-tech AR-like audiovisual method based on spatial pointers on a transparent film and audio cues. We conduct experiments with 31 participants and mount over 400 attacks to show that our methods enable attackers to successfully bypass keystroke dynamics for 87% of the attacks after an average mimicry training of four minutes. Our AR-based method can be extended to attack other input behaviour-based biometrics. While the particular attack we describe is relatively narrow, it is a good example of using AR guidance to enable successful mimicry of user behaviour---an approach of increasing concern as AR functionality becomes more commonplace.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 16th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "13", "keywords": ["Authentication", "Behavioural biometrics", "Mimicry attacks", "Augmented reality"], "location": "Munich, Germany", "series": "MobiSys '18"}
