However, to this date, it is not clear how these tools compare to one another, as they have been evaluated on arbitrary, disjointed set of Android apps, for which there is no ground truth, i.e., verified set of event races. To fill this gap and support future research in this area, we introduce BenchERoid, a set of 34 Android apps with injected event-race bugs. The current version of benchmark contains 36 types of event-race bugs that were identified by analyzing Android concurrency literature and publicly available issue repositories. We believe that our framework is a valuable resource for both developers and researchers interested in concurrency bug analysis in Android. BenchERoid is publicly available at: https://github.com/seal-hub/bencheroid.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["benchmark", "concurrency", "event-race", "android"], "location": "Toronto, Ontario, Canada", "series": "MobiSys '20"}
