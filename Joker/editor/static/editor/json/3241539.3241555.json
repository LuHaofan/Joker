The IEEE 802.11-2016 now includes a Fine Time Measurement (FTM) protocol for WiFi ranging, and several WiFi chipsets offer hardware support albeit without fully functional open software. This paper introduces an open platform for experimenting with fine time measurements and a general, repeatable, and accurate measurement framework for evaluating time-based ranging systems. We analyze the key factors and parameters that affect the ranging performance and revisit standard error correction techniques for WiFi time-based ranging system. The results confirm that meter-level ranging accuracy is possible as promised, but the measurements also show that this can only be consistently achieved in low-multipath environments such as open outdoor spaces or with denser access point deployments to enable ranging at or above 80 MHz bandwidth.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "11", "keywords": ["ranging evaluation", "fine time measurements", "wifi localization"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
