In the last two decades, many cities have adopted policies to control the emission of pollutants to the atmosphere as well as to promote sustainable urban developments. However, many of these initiatives have concluded that a long term success would require investing in the environmental literacy of the general population. In this demonstration paper, we present USC AiR, a mobile application that translates the air quality sensor feeds from the CCITI smart campus testbed into augmented reality visualizations for the USC community. USC AiR also allows users to report alarming air quality conditions and recommend environmental interventions such as planting trees. We believe that the integration of augmented reality for air quality monitoring enables the citizens to become more engaged with the air quality data while encouraging them to contribute to the reduction of anthropogenic air pollutants.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["iot", "smart campus", "air quality", "mixed reality", "smart city", "augmented reality"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
