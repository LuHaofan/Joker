Two full-duplex nodes potentially have 2\\texttimes{} capacity in wireless communications, compared to two half-duplex nodes. Organize the two nodes as one unit and reorganize nodes to be the units in multi-hop paths, the capacity can achieve 1\\texttimes{} to 2\\texttimes{} under space division simultaneous transmission mode, which is verified by analysis and simulation results.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["wireless networks", "capacity", "multi-hop", "joint node unit"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
