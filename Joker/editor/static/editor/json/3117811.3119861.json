In this demo, we demonstrate that another powerful solution for extending physical layer flexibility in OFDM-based technologies is the dynamic adaptation of the channel width. Although some standards already define the possibility of utilizing multiple channel widths (e.g. 20MHz, 10MHz, 5MHz for IEEE 802.11a standards), such an utilization is limited to a static configuration of a value defined during the network set-up. Conversely, we demonstrate that channel width adaptations can be performed in real-time during network operation, even on a per-packet basis. To this purpose, we propose an innovative and efficient receiver design, which allows the transmitter to take decisions about the channel width without explicitly informing the receiver.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["IEEE 802.11", "cognitive radio", "SDR", "WiFi"], "location": "Snowbird, Utah, USA", "series": "MobiCom '17"}
