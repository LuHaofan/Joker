While promising, a fundamental challenge is that proactive transport requires at least one-RTT for credits to be computed and delivered. In this paper, we show such one-RTT \"pre-credit\" phase could carry a substantial amount of flows at high link-speeds, but none of existing proactive solutions treats it appropriately. We present Aeolus, a solution focusing on \"pre-credit\" packet transmission as a building block for proactive transports. Aeolus contains unconventional design principles such as scheduled-packet-first (SPF) that de-prioritizes the first-RTT packets, instead of prioritizing them as prior work. It further exploits the preserved, deterministic nature of proactive transport as a means to recover lost first-RTT packets efficiently. We have integrated Aeolus into ExpressPass[14], NDP[18] and Homa[29], and shown, through both implementation and simulations, that the Aeolus-enhanced solutions deliver signiicant performance or deployability advantages. For example, it improves the average FCT of ExpressPass by 56%, cuts the tail FCT of Homa by 20x, while achieving similar performance as NDP without switch modifications.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication on the Applications, Technologies, Architectures, and Protocols for Computer Communication", "numpages": "13", "keywords": ["Selective Dropping", "Data Center Networks", "Proactive Transport", "First RTT"], "location": "Virtual Event, USA", "series": "SIGCOMM '20"}
