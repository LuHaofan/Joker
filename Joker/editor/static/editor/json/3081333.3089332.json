Imagine that they hold up their smartphone displays which collectively compose a huge public screen; the crowd's messages are now shown big on the top of them. We present CaaS [3], a mobile service to realize such an instant, massive, collective visualization with commodity smartphones and cloud services. In this demo, we demonstrate the collective localization feature of CaaS so that the audience can watch a given pattern or symbol collectively displayed on top of arbitrarily positioned phones (See the video demo, https://goo.gl/GfsORc).", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["visible light communication", "mobile-crowd service", "relative localization", "collective visualization", "optimization", "card stunt"], "location": "Niagara Falls, New York, USA", "series": "MobiSys '17"}
