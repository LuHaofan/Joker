In the meantime, more and more mobile workloads and optimizations now rely on the cloud, such as mobile cloud offloading, cloud-based mobile web optimization, and cloud-based network traffic redundancy reduction. However, it is hard to perform large-scale and personalized support or optimization for mobile workloads without significant computation resource increase on the cloud, as well as higher bandwidth requirement on the networks. We target solving the above two problems by enabling edge-hosed personalized services (EPS for short). The idea of EPS is twofold. One is enabling developer-customizable and power-and-traffic-efficient network communication on the \"last-hop\" communication between mobile devices and the network edge. The other is distributing cloud services for mobile workloads to network edge, so that they can be done on a personalized basis, while enjoying much lower communication latency to/from mobile devices.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["mobile devices", "network bandwdith", "edge computing"], "location": "Niagara Falls, New York, USA", "series": "MobiSys '17"}
