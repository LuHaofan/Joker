One popular mechanism to achieve accurate indoor localization as well as a map of the space is using Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (Visual-SLAM). However, Visual-SLAM is known to be resource-intensive in memory and processing time. Further, some of the operations grow in complexity over time, making it challenging to run on mobile devices continuously. Edge computing provides additional compute and memory resources to mobile devices to allow offloading of some tasks without the large latencies seen when offloading to the cloud. In this paper, we present Edge-SLAM, a system that uses edge computing resources to offload parts of Visual-SLAM. We use ORB-SLAM2 as a prototypical Visual-SLAM system and modify it to a split architecture between the edge and the mobile device. We keep the tracking computation on the mobile device and move the rest of the computation, i.e., local mapping and loop closure, to the edge. We describe the design choices in this effort and implement them in our prototype. Our results show that our split architecture can allow the functioning of the Visual-SLAM system long-term with limited resources without affecting the accuracy of operation. It also keeps the computation and memory cost on the mobile device constant which would allow for deployment of other end applications that use Visual-SLAM.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "13", "keywords": ["mapping", "edge computing", "visual simultaneous localization and mapping", "mobile systems", "split architecture", "localization"], "location": "Toronto, Ontario, Canada", "series": "MobiSys '20"}
