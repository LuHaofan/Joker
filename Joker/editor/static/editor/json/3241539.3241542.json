We demonstrate that LiSteer maintains beam alignment at the narrowest beamwidth level even in case of device mobility, without incurring any training overhead at mobile devices. Our extensive evaluation on a custom dual-band hardware platform comprising highly directional horn antennas as well as practical phased antenna arrays with electronic beam steering shows that LiSteer achieves direction estimates within 2.5 degrees of ground truth on average. Moreover, it achieves beam steering accuracy of more than 97% while in tracking mode, without incurring any client beam training or feedback overhead.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "16", "keywords": ["visible light sensing", "beam steering", "phased array", "mobility estimation", "aoa", "60 ghz", "mobile sensing", "beamforming", "mmwave", "beam training"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
