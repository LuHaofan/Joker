It is data plausibility, which is not addressed in any standard that comprises the WAVE framework. In particular, an attacker may forge false position values in safety beacons in order to cause unsafe response from startled receiving vehicles. The data plausibility is a longstanding issue for which various approaches based on sensor fusion, behavior analysis and communication constraints have been proposed. However, none of these completely solve the problem.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["vehicular communication"], "location": "Niagara Falls, New York, USA", "series": "MobiSys '17"}
