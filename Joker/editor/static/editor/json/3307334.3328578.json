A number of research have been explored on enriching family interaction by augmenting an interaction channel with asynchronous communication [6] or additional sensory stimuli [5]. However, it is still far from achieving a sense of living together for family members involuntarily living apart, especially in context-aware impromptu interaction. For families living together, it is trivial to naturally perceive behavioral and situational contexts of the other and initiate a relevant interaction intuitively. For example, a wife starts a casual chat with asking her husband what he is going to cook when she sees him going to the kitchen or hears a simmering sound.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["context-aware impromptu interaction", "robotic avatar", "peripheral awareness"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
