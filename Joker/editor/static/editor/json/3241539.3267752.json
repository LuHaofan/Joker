Wi-Cache is motivated by the belief that edge caching technologies are needed to augment emerging network technologies to meet the increasing (volume, quality, and variety) demand for content, which is itself changing its characteristics significantly. Wi-Cache is being used to test new ideas for edge caching. Specifically, Wi-Cache is a framework for edge caching which allows caching and delivery of content on WiFi APs. Apart from a network induced handoff of clients, it allows communication between the APs for content delivery. We have also developed an API that is exposed for implementation of algorithms for content delivery and placement, and cache replacement.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["cache", "SDN", "WiFi", "API"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
