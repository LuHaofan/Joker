Private 4G/5G networks typically face the challenge of supporting heterogeneous industrial applications. This technology demonstration highlights the importance of network slicing in private 4G/5G networks. It shows that network slicing is crucial for performance guarantees in multiservice co-existence scenarios. With network slicing, our private 4G/5G network successfully supports closed-loop control, event-driven control and video streaming applications.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3"}
