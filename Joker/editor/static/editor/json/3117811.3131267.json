A machine-type communication system is adopted for the delivery of ECG data to benefit from its inherent reliability, pervasiveness, security, and performance of 4G long-term evolution technologies with reduced cost and enhanced coverage. Extensive evaluations indicate that the proposed system provides a sufficient level of service for medical-grade instantaneous ECG monitoring even under significantly deteriorated channel conditions.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["conservative modulation and coding", "machine-type communications", "low-latency", "electrocardiography"], "location": "Snowbird, Utah, USA", "series": "MobiCom '17"}
