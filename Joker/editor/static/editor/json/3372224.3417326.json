However, the resource requirements of Visual-SLAM prevents long-operation of such algorithm on mobile devices. We demonstrate Edge-SLAM [2], a system that adapts edge computing into Visual-SLAM through a split architecture. Edge-SLAM offloads the compute-intensive modules of Visual-SLAM to the edge without losing accuracy. Our experiments show that Edge-SLAM architecture reduces the use of computation and memory resources on mobile devices and keeps it constant. Thus, enabling long-operation of Visual-SLAM along with other applications services on mobile devices.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3"}
