To support its diverse operating conditions, a set of different OFDM numerologies has been defined in the standards body. Under this numerology, it is necessary to perform scheduling with a time resolution of \u223c100 \u03bcs. This requirement poses a new challenge that does not exist in LTE and cannot be supported by any existing LTE schedulers. In this paper, we present the design of GPF -- a GPU-based proportional fair (PF) scheduler that can meet the \u223c100 \u03bcs time requirement. The key ideas include decomposing the scheduling problem into a large number of small and independent sub-problems and selecting a subset of sub-problems from the most promising search space to fit into a GPU. By implementing GPF on an off-the-shelf Nvidia Quadro P6000 GPU, we show that GPF is able to achieve near-optimal performance while meeting the \u223c100 $mathrm\u03bcs time requirement. GPF represents the first successful design of a GPU-based PF scheduler that can meet the new time requirement in NR.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "16", "keywords": ["5g nr", "gpu", "optimization", "real-time", "resource scheduling"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
