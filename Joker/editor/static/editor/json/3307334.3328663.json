We show that standard resource allocation scheme for Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication mode 4, with fixed transmission power, has room for improvement. Assuming channel reciprocity, proposed algorithm estimates neighbor's SINR and controls transmission power based on the estimation. We show that proposed scheme enhances system level PRR and also, performance of the algorithm increases as vehicles get more dense.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["v2v", "power control", "cellular v2x", "mode 4", "cam"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
