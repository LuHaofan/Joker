To our knowledge, our work represents the first effort that combines an open source Open RAN framework with an open source mobility stack, provides a top-to-bottom RAN application via the RAN intelligent control (RIC) provided by that framework and illustrates its functionality in a realistic wireless environment. Our software is publicly available and we provide a profile in the POWDER platform to enable others to replicate and build on our work.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["RAN slicing", "open RAN", "programmability"], "location": "Virtual Event, Wisconsin", "series": "MobiSys '21"}
