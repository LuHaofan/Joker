We propose the Age Control Protocol (ACP), which, in a network-transparent manner, enables a source to keep the age at the monitor small. We evaluate it using simulations and real-world experiments.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["RTT", "age", "age of information", "status updates", "backlog", "congestion"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
