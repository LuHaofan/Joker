While many RSS-based device-free localization systems can detect a line crossing, this system estimates additionally the speed of crossing, which can provide significant additional information to a tracking system. Further, unlike device-free RF sensors which occupy tens of MHz of bandwidth, this system uses a channel of about 10 kHz. Experiments with a person walking from 0.3 to 1.8 m/s show the system can measure walking speed within 0.05 m/s RMS error.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["human speed estimation", "received signal strength"], "location": "Snowbird, Utah, USA", "series": "MobiCom '17"}
