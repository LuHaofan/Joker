Beacon and probe responses can be extended by adding additional information (so-called beacon stuffing) making it possible to deliver this information to mobile devices (e.g. smart-phones equipped with 802.11 interfaces) without the need for association with the local infrastructure. This feature can be used to support location-based information services (LBS) related for e.g. advertising local opportunities, temporary obstacles and traffic disturbances or emergency notifications. In this paper we introduce a demonstrator for Location-based Wi-Fi Services (LoWS) based on beacon stuffing. The LoWS system can be easily installed within an existent 802.11 infrastructure while the receiver application can be installed on nearly all up-to-date commercial off-the-shelf smartphones, e.g. based on Android or iOS.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["lows", "beacon stuffing", "location-based wi-fi services", "IEEE 802.11", "LBS"], "location": "Snowbird, Utah, USA", "series": "MobiCom '17"}
