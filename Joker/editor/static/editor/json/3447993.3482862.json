AirSimN is different from all prior attempts in the literature because it concurrently supports aerodynamic, computer vision, and network simulations. We carefully design it to minimize the effort of realizing virtually arbitrary drone applications, thanks to the active and popular AirSim and NS-3 projects. Many mobile computing and wireless networking projects on, e.g., drone feedback controllers, drone vision algorithms, and 5G/6G cellular network planning, can leverage AirSimN for large-scale evaluations.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 27th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3"}
