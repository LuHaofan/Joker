Each integrated FD radio consists of an antenna, a customized Gen-2 RF self-interference (SI) canceller box, a USRP software-defined radio, and a remotely accessible compute node. The RF SI canceller box includes an RF canceller printed circuit board which emulates an integrated circuit implementation based on the technique of frequency-domain equalization. The Gen-2 canceller box can achieve up to 50 dB RF SI cancellation across 20MHz bandwidth. In this demo, we present the design and implementation of the open-acccess, remotely accessible FD radios that are integrated in the indoor COSMOS Sandbox 2 at Columbia University. We also demonstrate example experiments that are available to researchers, where demo participants can observe the visualized performance of the open-access FD radios.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3"}
