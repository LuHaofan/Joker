However, there do not exist any mmWave radio platforms with phased arrays available to the networking community. All existing mmWave platforms use horn antennas which require mechanical steering and are not suitable for non-static links or multi-user networks. We have built MiRa: a full-fledged mmWave radio with phased arrays capable of beam steering. MiRa operates as a daughterboard for the USRP software radio which enables easy manipulation of mmWave signals using standard GNU-radio software. With its reconfigurable architecture, steerable phased arrays and open SDR platform, MiRa can help advance mmWave research in the mobile and networking community.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["millimeter wave", "wireless", "phased array"], "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
