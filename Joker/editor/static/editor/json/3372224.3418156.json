In this paper, we first explain how the structures of overpasses and bridges have special magnetic fields. We then propose how to use the magnetometers which come with off-the-shelf smartphones to assist GPS navigators to determine position on multi-layer roads by detecting and matching these magnetic fingerprints. We also present performance evaluation on different multi-layer roads to show the feasibility of the proposed method.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3"}
