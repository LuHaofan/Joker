It can support to make decisions of mobile terminals (ex. threat assessment in an autonomous vehicle) operating in various situations under uncertain reality. Unlike a single simulation, which is executed in one mobile terminal using data collected from the same terminal, a multiple simulation, which supports to make sophisticated decisions through data collected from multiple terminals, is not only complicated to implement but also requires a large number of computations and has network delay problem in collecting data from plenty of data sources [1]. Consequently, it is impossible to implement in a single mobile terminal.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["simulation offloading", "kubernetes", "simulation-as-a-service", "multi-access edge computing"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
