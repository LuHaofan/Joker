However, each of these systems has its own downsides, such as a lack of infrastructure, power consumption and proneness to noise. These are the reasons no such system is currently able to be truly considered as the \"GPS for the indoors\", as they cannot provide worldwide coverage.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["landmarks", "indoor localization", "isovist", "sensor-independent"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
