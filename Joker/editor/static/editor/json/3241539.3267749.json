To realize the idea of SBA, we propose Service Level Virtualization (SLV) in which each network entity is decomposed into different service blocks to provide respective services. In addition, each service block can be virtualized independently into different virtual machine. Thus, SLV can increase the flexibility of the core network.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["service based architecture", "5G", "open source"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
