This heterogeneity is in two aspects, namely, the lifetime of the data and the size of the data. We propose a caching policy which divides the cache into sub-caches, such that each sub-cache is reserved for data of a specific size and lifetime. Via analytical results and simulations, we show that our policy outperforms existing caching policies for heterogeneous data.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["class of producers", "FIFO", "split cache", "freshness"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
