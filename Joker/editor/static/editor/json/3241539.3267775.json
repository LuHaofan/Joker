For the trusted communication between involved entities, an effective authentication technique must be applied to ensure privacy and confidentiality. As the wearable devices are resource-constraint, we propose a lightweight mutually authenticated key-agreement scheme for wireless body area networks using simple XOR and one-way cryptographic hash functions. The proposed scheme enables the wearable sensing device to authenticate the mobile terminal and establish a secret session key. We measure the performance analysis of our proposed scheme with other related schemes regarding computational and communication cost.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["IoT", "WBAN", "mutual authentication", "key agreement"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
