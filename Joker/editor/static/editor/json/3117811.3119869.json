DEMS consists of three key design decisions: (1) being aware of the chunk boundary and strategically decoupling the paths for chunk delivery, (2) ensuring simultaneous subflow completion at the receiver side, and (3) allowing a path to trade a small amount of redundant data for performance. We integrate the DEMS components into a holistic system and implement it on commodity mobile devices, where unmodified mobile applications can use DEMS to transmit data over multipath. We demonstrate the simple configuration of using DEMS over multipath, visualization of multipath scheduling, download time reduction of data chunks with DEMS over both emulated and real cellular/WiFi networks compared to default MinRTT scheduler, and application QoE improvement on mobile phones from DEMS.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["decoupled packet scheduling", "multipath scheduler", "reinjection", "chunk download", "mobile networks", "MPTCP", "multipath transport", "simultaneous subflow completion"], "location": "Snowbird, Utah, USA", "series": "MobiCom '17"}
