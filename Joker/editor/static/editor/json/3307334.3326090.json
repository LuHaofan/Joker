Today's systems commonly rely on dedicated infrastructure to track the controller or only provide inertial-based rotational tracking, which severely limits the user experience. Optical inside-out systems offer mobility but require line-of-sight and bulky tracking rings, which limit the ubiquity of these devices. In this work, we present Aura, an inside-out electromagnetic 6-DoF tracking system for handheld controllers. The tracking system consists of three coils embedded in a head-mounted display and a set of orthogonal receiver coils embedded in a handheld controller. We propose a novel closed-form and computationally simple tracking approach to reconstruct position and orientation in real time. Our handheld controller is small enough to fit in a pocket and consumes 45 mW of power, allowing it to operate for multiple days on a typical battery. An evaluation study demonstrates that Aura achieves a median tracking error of 5.5 mm and 0.8 degrees in 3D space within arm's reach.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "13", "keywords": ["electromagnetic tracking", "mixed reality", "head-mounted display", "controller", "virtual reality"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
