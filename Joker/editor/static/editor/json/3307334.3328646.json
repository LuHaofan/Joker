Existing mobile platforms can be used to assist offline shoppers, but there still remain questions about the usability and affordability of such platforms. To reduce this gap, we propose SEEjang, a prototype for providing users with a smart, easy, and economical experience with offline shopping. We developed the application through a design thinking process to maximize consumer satisfaction with offline shopping.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["offline shopping experiences", "user centered design", "human-computer interaction", "mobile computing", "design thinking"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
