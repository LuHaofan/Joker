However, mmWave links are notorious for low reliability since they suffer from frequent outages due to blockage and user mobility. We build mmReliable, a reliable mmWave system that implements multi-beamforming and user tracking to handle environmental vulnerabilities. It creates constructive multi-beam patterns and optimizes their angle, phase, and amplitude to maximize the signal strength at the receiver. Multi-beam links are reliable since they are resilient to occasional blockages of few constituent beams compared to a single-beam system. We implement mmReliable on a 28 GHz testbed with 400 MHz bandwidth, and a 64 element phased array supporting 5G NR waveforms. Rigorous indoor and outdoor experiments demonstrate that mmReliable achieves close to 100% reliability providing 2.3x improvement in the throughput-reliability product than single-beam systems.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGCOMM 2021 Conference", "numpages": "15", "keywords": ["reliability", "phased arrays", "5G NR", "throughput", "analog beamforming", "millimeter-wave", "multi-beam", "tracking", "blockage", "mobility"], "location": "Virtual Event, USA", "series": "SIGCOMM '21"}
