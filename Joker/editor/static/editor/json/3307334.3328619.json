In this paper, we proposed the visualization method for the city model using VWorld data. Anyone can use through the VWorld 3D map service site. We expect that our platform can be used to visualize 3D spatial information for various applications.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["vworld", "3d map", "gis"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
