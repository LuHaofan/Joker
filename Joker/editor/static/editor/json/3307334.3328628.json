The detection of misplaced tags on stationary shelved items is very challenging due to position ambiguity, phase wrapping, device diversity, and phase ambiguity. We propose an effective way of detecting misplaced tags, called FINDS, that requires neither antenna movement nor external disturbances.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["misplaced tags", "rfid", "stationary tags"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
