But the lack of an accessible experimental platform has been impeding its progress. We propose to overcome the barrier with OpenMili, a reconfigurable 60 GHz radio architecture. OpenMili builds from off-the-shelf FPGA processor, data converters and 60 GHz RF front-end. It employs customized clocking, channelization and interfacing modules, to achieve Gsps sampling bandwidth, Gbps wireless bit-rate, and Gsps sample streaming from/to a PC host. It also incorporates the first programmable, electronically steerable 60 GHz phased-array antenna. OpenMili adopts programming models that ease development, through automatic parallelization inside signal processing blocks, and modular, rate-insensitive interfaces across blocks. In this demo, we will showcase OpenMili's hardware modules, and demonstrate example communication and sensing applications based on it.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
