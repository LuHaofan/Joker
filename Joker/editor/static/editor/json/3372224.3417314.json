The novelty of the proposed system is that it allows each user to watch the same video content on their own device at the same time. This entails proposing a method to exchange the downloaded video chunks among the users using device-to-device communication. The proposed system is composed of two components: BeeBuzzer, and BeePlanner. The BeePlanner component performs chunk scheduling, while the BeeBuzzer component manages and coordinates the chunk exchange among devices.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3"}
