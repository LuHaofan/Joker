In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of implementing such a magic window, addressing two important requirements: (1) the quality of transformed images (from the nighttime to the daytime) and (2) the frame rate of transformed image stream. We present our initial ideas to address the problem and report preliminary results towards the experience of daytime driving at night.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["image translation", "image interpolation", "real-time processing"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
