Due to the very complex de- pendency between the radio conditions and the computing resources needed to provide the baseband processing func- tionality, attaining an efficient resource control is particularly challenging. In this demonstration, we will showcase vrAIn, a vRAN dynamic resource controller that employs deep re- inforcement learning to perform resource assignment deci- sions. vrAIn, which is implemented using an open-source LTE stack over a Linux platform, can achieve substantial sav- ings in the used CPU resources while maintaining the target QoS for the attached terminals and maximize throughput when there is a deficit of computational capacity.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["mobile networks.", "network measurement", "programmable networks"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
