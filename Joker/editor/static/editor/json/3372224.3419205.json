Most of the time, location, device, and app information are linked to the same device using a unique advertising ID (Ad ID). If the Ad ID is not available, advertisers can still use geo-coordinates or IP address to infer links in data gathered from different ad placements.Even though the Ad ID can be disabled by users on both OSes, we demonstrate that advertisers can leave their own unique strings (marks) in the app storage, and use these strings to link information collected from ads. Users cannot clear these marks without losing all data within the app. Because advertising platforms allow connection filtering and geofencing, users who either connect using a non-cellular IP address or allow location access to the app are substantially easier to be rediscovered by the advertiser.We carried out many large-scale experiments on iOS and Android devices involving hundreds of thousands of impressions. We found that on average 49% of impressions from an iOS device, and 59% of Android impressions could be re-identified for less than $5/day per device using this strategy. We subsequently verified this method on 1,727 devices and recovered 660 of them within 48 hours for $86.73. Finally, we explore the behavior of privacy-seeking VPN users. We found that for the majority, their clearnet IP address and location could be unmasked easily using ads.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "13"}
