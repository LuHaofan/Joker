Sonoloc enables users to address each other based on their relative positions at events like meetings, talks, or conferences. This capability can, for instance, aid spontaneous communication among users based on their relative position (e.g., in a given section of a room, at the same table, or in a given seat), facilitate interaction between speaker and audience in a lecture hall, and enable the distribution of materials, crowdsensing, and feedback collection based on users' location. Sonoloc can position any number of devices within acoustic range with a constant number of chirps emitted by a self-organized subset of devices. Our experimental evaluation shows that the system can locate up to hundreds of devices with an accuracy of tens of centimeters using up to 15 audio chirps emitted by dynamically selected devices, in actual rooms and despite substantial background noise.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 16th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "14", "location": "Munich, Germany", "series": "MobiSys '18"}
