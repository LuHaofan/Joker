The required aperture, power consumption, and hardware complexity of the traditional array-based spatial sensing techniques make them unsuitable for small and power-constrained IoT devices. Aiming to overcome these fundamental limitations, Owlet explores acoustic microstructures for extracting spatial information. It uses a carefully designed 3D-printed metamaterial structure that covers the microphone. The structure embeds a direction-specific signature in the recorded sounds. Owlet system learns the directional signatures through a one-time in-lab calibration. The system uses an additional microphone as a reference channel and develops techniques that eliminate environmental variation, making the design robust to noises and multipaths in arbitrary locations of operations. Owlet prototype shows 3.6\u00b0 median error in DoA estimation and 10cm median error in source localization while using a 1.5cm \\texttimes{} 1.3cm acoustic structure for sensing. The prototype consumes less than 100th of the energy required by a traditional microphone array to achieve similar DoA estimation accuracy. Owlet opens up possibilities of low-power sensing through 3D-printed passive structures.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "14", "keywords": ["spatial sensing", "low-power sensing", "IoT", "acoustic metamaterial"], "location": "Virtual Event, Wisconsin", "series": "MobiSys '21"}
