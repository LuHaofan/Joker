In this research, we use textual signs and their geographical relationships inside a building as semantic signatures to design an infrastructureless indoor navigation system without a site survey. We propose a computer vision-based approach, which takes as an input a floor plan image and automatically infers the floor graph. The constructed graph is then used to estimate the shortest path, which is a sequence of store names, that the user needs to pass to reach her destination.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["android application", "semantic signature", "computer vision", "indoor navigation"], "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
