The key observation is that the raw phase measurements even measured form different RFID tags contain a same set of unknown phase errors. With enough tags' phase measurements, we can determine all the unknown phase errors, since the number of known phase measurements is much larger than the number of unknown phase errors. Real-world experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["DOA estimation", "phase error calibration"], "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
