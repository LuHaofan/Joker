In this work, we show that broad classes of popular mobile applications have distinct radio resource allocation signatures. Using this insight, we design a mobile application classifier, and demonstrate that (1) an application can infer its own type solely from its resource allocation patterns, and (2) anyone can accurately infer the type of application being served by each session on a particular cell tower. We present our findings by showing the breakdown of applications being served by an LTE base station belonging to a Tier 1 US provider in downtown Palo Alto. Our work encourages an open discussion about LTE standards, and whether they might need to be enhanced to mask features that can be exploited to infer application type from signals broadcast over the air.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["cellular", "resource allocation", "PHY", "application classification", "LTE"], "location": "Snowbird, Utah, USA", "series": "MobiCom '17"}
