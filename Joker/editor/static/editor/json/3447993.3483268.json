The key enabling technology behind PCube is a novel air-channel phase measurement technique which is able to extract phase differences of air-channels between LoRa nodes and multiple antennas of a gateway. PCube leverages the reception diversities of multiple receiving antennas of a gateway and scales the concurrent transmissions of a large number of LoRa nodes, even exceeding the number of receiving antennas at a gateway. As a phase-based parallel decoder, PCube provides a new dimension to resolve collisions and supports more concurrent transmissions by complementing time and frequency based parallel decoders. PCube is implemented and evaluated with synchronized software defined radios and off-the-shelf LoRa nodes in both indoors and outdoors. Results demonstrate that PCube can substantially outperform state-of-the-art works in terms of aggregated throughput by 4.9\\texttimes{} and the number of concurrent nodes by up to 5\\texttimes{}. More importantly, PCube scales well with the number of receiving antennas of a gateway, which is promising to break the barrier of concurrent transmissions.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 27th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "14"}
