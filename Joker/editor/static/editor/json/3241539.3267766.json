There are some solutions, including cryptographic and information-theory schemes, just can thwart data pollution attacks but are not able to detect replay attacks. In the paper, we present a lightweight timestamp-based message authentication code method, called as TMAC. Based on TMAC and the time synchronization technique, the proposed detection scheme can not only resist pollution attacks but also defend replay attacks simultaneously.
