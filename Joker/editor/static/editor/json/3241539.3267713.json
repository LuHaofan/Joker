The phenomenon is common in smart factories and smart homes which generously use ZigBee sensors for process monitoring and automation. This interferes with omnipresent WiFi in the same 2.4 GHz ISM band. In our demonstration, we will present Software Defined Radio (SDR) based single antenna and multi-antenna prototype of standard-compliant IEEE 802.11g receiver. Our receiver prototype is capable of significantly reducing the packet error rate while facing multiple co-channel narrowband ZigBee interferers. We also demonstrate a real-time SDR implementation of Soft Bit Maximal Ratio Combiner capable of decoding frames from standard compliant IEEE 802.11g transmitters. This is a first of its kind implementation to the best of author's knowledge. The demonstrations use Ettus B210 as SDR hardware and a combination of signal processing modules from two different SDR packages: GNU Radio and Openairinterface.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["interference mitigation", "ZigBee", "co-channel interference", "WiFi"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
