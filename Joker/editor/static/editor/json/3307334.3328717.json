Especially, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors are widely used to obtain dataset to train ML models for human activity recognition. A key challenge in building highly accurate ML models lies in collecting a wide variety of activity data from a large number of users. Such data collection is often a highly time-consuming and costly process.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["machine learning", "simulation", "human activity recognition", "sensor"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
