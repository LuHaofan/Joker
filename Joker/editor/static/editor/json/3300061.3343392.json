However, the heterogeneous structure of the in-vehicle network and lack of security consideration has introduced a lack of scalability and security concerns. In this work, we propose a shuffling-based moving target defense (MTD) technique aiming to disturb network reconnaissance attacks and deployed it in the proposed software-defined networking (SDN)-based in-vehicle network architecture. To validate the proposed MTD, we compare the service availability of our proposed MTD and non-MTD counterpart in the presence of the reconnaissance-based false message injection attacks.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["moving target defense", "software-defined networking", "in-vehicle networks"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
