Approaches are proposed to improve the robustness of the design in the low signal-to-noise ratio environment. We also share our solution to several engineering challenges, which aims at facilitating the transformation of earbuds to into acoustic sensing research platforms without any hardware modification.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "location": "Virtual Event, Wisconsin", "series": "MobiSys '21"}
