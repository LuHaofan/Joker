IoT and MR, the technologies that have become popular nowadays, expected to play a key role in this domain. In this paper, we will introduce MR and IoT Convergence Platform with AI Support for Disaster Recognition This platform can recognize a disaster situation with sensors and AI system, and report to the user's MR devices. Also, we build a prototype using OneM2M-based Mobius Platform, Microsoft Hololens, and CNN-based AI Camera for proving feasibility.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["internet of things", "artificial intelligence", "disaster recognition", "mixed-reality", "disaster countermeasure"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
