However, a reliable inference of 3D cellular coverage is required to provide seamless imagery. As a part of intercontinental 5G testbed activities within Korea-EU 5G Project (PriMO-5G), we construct 3D 5G coverage map manually, to present insights regarding 3D coverage and how to construct its map efficiently. We then devise algorithms for constructing 3D coverage map simultaneously with real-time airborne missions in a cost-effective manner.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3"}
