However, they require decorrelation techniques to resolve coherent multipath components. The conventional decorrelation techniques reduce the effective aperture of the MIMO array, thus reducing the resolution and number of resolved paths. In this paper, we introduce MIMO smoothing as a new technique to bring decorrelation effect by leveraging the spacial and frequential diversity in MIMO transmitters and receivers. Via extensive experiments on WiFi links, we show that MIMO smoothing can increase the accuracy of multipath resolution.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["multipath resolution", "CSI", "spatial diversity", "MIMO smoothing"], "location": "Snowbird, Utah, USA", "series": "MobiCom '17"}
