Towards this ultimate goal, we first examine the relationship between LF/HF values in heart rate and the CDR (Call Detail Record) logs. Our evaluation result shows that different LF/HF values correspond to different types of mobile applications.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["lf/hf", "kolmogorov-smirnov test", "mobile application"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
