The framework eases the access, transmission and export of sensing data from the device. This data comprises: heart rate, raw acceleration, and computed device motion. In our demo, we present sample applications built on top of this framework to show its capabilities, of real-time presentation and recording of the sensing data.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["wearable computing", "sensing libraries"], "location": "Niagara Falls, New York, USA", "series": "MobiSys '17"}
