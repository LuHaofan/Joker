However, the cumulative increase of mobile terminals and emerging cloud applications, poses new challenges for edge networks. To combat this issue, the promising idea of mobile micro-clouds (MMCs) is proposed to enhance edges and the cloud. In this paper, we investigate the problem of virtual cluster (VC) placement in MMCs, to minimize the average response latency with various requests among multiple cloud applications. Then a hybrid swarm intelligence approach is proposed to optimize VC placement scheme, for a trade-off between the average response latency and the overall VC placement cost. The preliminary evaluation results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["virtual cluster placement", "cloud computing", "mobile edge computing", "average response time"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
