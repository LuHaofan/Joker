Field Operational Test (FOT) and real-world experimentation are becoming more relevant to our research community as well as to industry and regulation. Unfortunately, available commercial solutions make experimental modifications to the protocol stack time consuming or prohibit it completely. To overcome this limitation, we implemented the ETSI ITS-G5 stack on a standard embedded PC hardware and running Linux system. OpenC2X is the first complete Open Source experimentation and prototyping platform. Our system is fully interoperable to commercial solutions, yet easily extensible with new protocols and applications for vehicular networks.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["prototype", "vehicular networking", "field testing"], "location": "Niagara Falls, New York, USA", "series": "MobiSys '17"}
