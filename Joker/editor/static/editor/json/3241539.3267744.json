A lot of research work in SIoT has proposed the use of social networking data for community and trust management in SIoT networks. While it seems like an interesting choice, it is important to analyze the effectiveness of social networking data for application to SIoT. In this paper, we analyze the accuracy of using tie information from the Facebook Friend Graph to mimic real-world SIoT network ties. We also discuss a method for ranking the strength of ties in a SIoT network by analyzing the structure of the Facebook Friend Graph. A similar analysis can be performed on data available from other Social Networking platforms, like Twitter, LinkedIn etc.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["internet of things (IoT)", "trust management", "social iot (SIoT)", "social networks"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
