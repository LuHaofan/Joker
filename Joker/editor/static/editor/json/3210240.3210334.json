Journalists want to reliably turn off radios to protect their sources during investigative reporting. Users wish to ensure cameras and microphones are reliably off during private meetings. In this paper, we present SeCloak, an ARM TrustZone-based solution that ensures reliable on-off control of peripherals even when the platform software is compromised. We design a secure kernel that co-exists with software running on mobile devices (e.g., Android and Linux) without requiring any code modifications. An Android prototype demonstrates that mobile peripherals like radios, cameras, and microphones can be controlled reliably with a very small trusted computing base and with minimal performance overhead.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 16th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "13", "location": "Munich, Germany", "series": "MobiSys '18"}
