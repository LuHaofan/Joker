Analysis of the resulting dataset poses unique challenges; methods in the status quo are tailored for specific spectrum-related applications (apps), and are ill equipped to process data of this magnitude. In this paper, we design BigSpec, a general-purpose framework that allows for fast processing of apps. The key idea is to reduce computation costs by performing computation extensively on compressed data that preserves signal features. Adhering to this guideline, we build solutions for three apps, i.e., energy detection, spatio-temporal spectrum estimation, and anomaly detection. These apps were chosen to highlight BigSpec's efficiency, scalability, and extensibility. To evaluate BigSpec's performance, we collect more than 1 terabyte of spectrum data spanning a year, across 300MHz-4GHz, covering 400 km2. Compared with baselines and prior works, we achieve 17\\texttimes{} run time efficiency, sublinear rather than linear run time scalability, and extend the definition of anomaly to different domains (frequency &amp; spatio-temporal). We also obtain high-level insights from the data to provide valuable advice on future spectrum measurement and data analysis.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "16", "keywords": ["spectrum measurement", "spatio-temporal data analysis"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
