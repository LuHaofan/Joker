Recent advances in the RFIC community enabled wideband RF SI cancellation (SIC) in integrated circuits (ICs) via frequency-domain equalization (FDE), where reconfigurable RF filters are used to channelize the SI signal path. In [2], we designed and implemented an FDE-based RF canceller on a printed circuit board (PCB). We also presented an optimized canceller configuration scheme based on the derived canceller model, and extensively evaluated the performance of the FDE-based FD radios in a software-defined radio (SDR) testbed in different network settings.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["software-defined radios", "full-duplex wireless", "wideband self-interference cancellation", "frequency-domain equalization"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
