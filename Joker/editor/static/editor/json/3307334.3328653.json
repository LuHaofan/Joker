Most of indoor positioning is dependent on the installed facilities such as Wi-Fi APs and BLE beacons in service area. Without pre-surveyed information such as fingerprint database, one can not localize himself at the first visiting site.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["indoor positioning", "pedestrian dead reckoning", "heading adjustment"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
