In order for vehicles to obtain data, compute and other services from other vehicles or road-side infrastructure, it is important to be able to make micropayments for those services and for the services to run seamlessly despite the challenges posed by mobility and ephemeral interactions with a dynamic set of neighboring devices. We present MOTIVE, a trusted and decentralized framework that allows vehicles to make peer-to-peer micropayments for data, compute and other services obtained from other vehicles or road-side infrastructure within radio range. The framework utilizes distributed ledger technologies including smart contracts to enable autonomous operation and trusted interactions between vehicles and nearby entities.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["micropayments", "edge computing", "v2x", "blockchain", "connected and autonomous vehicles"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
