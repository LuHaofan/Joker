Our preliminary evaluation revealed interesting points for discussion regarding the procedure for capturing food labels. Streamlining the operational method to boost tractability will improve the accuracy when recording food intakes.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["mixed reality", "well-being", "gamification"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
