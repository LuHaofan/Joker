Virtualizing the mobile network components in a flexible and cost-effective way is therefore of paramount importance. In this work, we highlight the capabilities of Orion, a novel RAN slicing architecture that enables the dynamic virtualization of base stations and flexible customization of slices to meet their respective service needs. Our demonstration of Orion's capabilities is based on a prototype implementation employing a modified version of the OpenAirInterface software LTE platform. Using this prototype, we demonstrate the functional and performance isolation, and the efficient sharing of radio hardware and spectrum that can be achieved among Orion RAN slices. Moreover, we show how Orion can be used in an end-to-end network slicing setting and demonstrate the effects of the slices' configuration and placement of virtual functions in the overall quality of the deployed services.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["5G mobile networks", "network architecture", "ran virtualization", "ran slicing", "abstractions"], "location": "Snowbird, Utah, USA", "series": "MobiCom '17"}
