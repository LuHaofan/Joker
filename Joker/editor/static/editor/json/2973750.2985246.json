Machine learning is one of the promising approaches to discriminate the malicious applications from the benign ones. Despite its higher malware detection capability, a significant challenge remains: in adversarial environment, an attacker can adapt by maximally sabotaging classifiers by polluting training data. This paper proposes KuafuDet, a two-phase learning enhancing approach that adversarially detects the Android malware. Experiments on more than 50,000 Android applications demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
