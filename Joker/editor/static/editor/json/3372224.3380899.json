In-N-Out can continuously charge a medical implant residing in deep tissues at near-optimal beamforming power, even when the implant moves around inside the human body. To accomplish this, we exploit the unique energy ball pattern of distributed antenna array and devise a backscatter-assisted beamforming algorithm that can concentrate RF energy on a tiny spot surrounding the medical implant. Meanwhile, the power levels on other body parts stay in low level, reducing the risk of overheating. We proto-type In-N-Out on 21 software-defined radios and a printed circuit board (PCB). Extensive experiments demonstrate that In-N-Out achieves 0.37 mW average charging power inside a 10 cm-thick pork belly, which is sufficient to wirelessly power a range of commercial medical devices. Our head-to-head comparison with the state-of-the-art approach shows that In-N-Out achieves 5.4X-18.1X power gain when the implant is stationary, and 5.3X-7.4X power gain when the implant is in motion.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "15"}
