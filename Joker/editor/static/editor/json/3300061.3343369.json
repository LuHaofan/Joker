It achieves modulized, light-weight, low-cost, and high-performance design goals even with the existence of distributed sensors. The key idea is to utilize wearable devices to enhance the people tracking capability of a robot through instant wireless communications and multi-sensory data fusion. Experimental results in a realistic environment demonstrate that our robot can keep tracking a specific person at a safe distance even without seeing the biological features of the person, who walks in a crowd with complex trajectories.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["robotics", "robot operating system (ros)", "people identification and tracking (pidt)"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
