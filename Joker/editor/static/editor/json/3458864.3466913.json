Taking a cross-layer approach, LATTE first optimizes the MU-MIMO user group selection for the users with the same characteristics in the PHY/MAC layer. It then optimizes the video bitrate for each group accordingly. We present our design and its evaluation on smartphones over 802.11ac WiFi.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "location": "Virtual Event, Wisconsin", "series": "MobiSys '21"}
