With the help of advanced machine learning models (e.g., CNNs), those videos exhibit high business and social values, e.g., for retailing planning [18], wildlife study [21], and traffic monitoring [19, 25]. However, with high compute need, traditional video analytics systems [14, 15, 26, 27] require all videos to be uploaded to a backend server, which stresses the scarce network bandwidth between cameras and servers.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3"}
