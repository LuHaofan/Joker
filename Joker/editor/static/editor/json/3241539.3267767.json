To support this growing demand, the concept of nested-NEMO has evolved over the past few years. However, due to the inherent architecture of nested-NEMO, it is inefficient in terms of hand-off delay and throughput which hinder it to deploy as a highly scalable network. In this paper, we address the scalability issue of nested-NEMO and propose a hierarchical node attachment process for the mobile devices. The performance of the proposed mechanism has been evaluated where we computed the hand-off delay and throughput and observed that the proposed mechanism supports a considerable degree of scalability as compared to the existing nested network mobility architecture.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["scalability", "nested nemo", "network mobility", "mobile network"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
