                    "abstract": "Billions of smoke detectors are in use worldwide to provide early warning of fires. Despite this, they frequently fail to operate in an ongoing fire, risking death and property damage. A significant fraction of faults result from drift, or reduced sensitivity, and other faults in smoke detectors' phototransistors (PTs). Existing approaches attempt to detect drift from the PT output in normal conditions (without smoke). However, we find that drifted PTs mimic the output of working PTs in normal conditions, but diverge in the presence of smoke, making this approach ineffective.This paper presents two novel approaches to systematically detect faults and measure and compensate for drift in smoke detectors' PTs. Our first approach, called FallTime, measures a PT \"fingerprint,\" a unique electrical characteristic with distinct behavior for working, drifted, and faulty components. FallTime can be added to many existing smoke detector models in software alone, with no/minimal hardware modifications. Our second approach, DriftTestButton, is a mechanical test button that simulates the behavior of smoke when pressed. It offers a robust, straightforward approach to detect faults, and can measure and compensate for drift across the entire smoke detector system. We empirically evaluate both approaches and present extensive experimental results from actual smoke detectors deployed in a commercial building, along with custom-built smoke detectors. By conducting tests with live smoke, we show that both FallTime and DriftTestButton perform more effectively than existing fault tolerance techniques and stand to substantially reduce the risk that a smoke detector fails to alarm in the presence of smoke.",

System researchers however also have a responsibility to build systems that can impact practice in the near-term and perhaps, even create a brand new industry. In my talk, I will focus on my efforts so far navigating this chasm between curiosity and impact driven research. Specifically, I will share two research themes I have been working on as an assistant professor at UW CSE, where what initially began as curiosity-driven projects were transformed by the urge to make immediate practical impact as well as be unique. In particular, I will first talk about our journey going from a science-driven project on ambient backscatter (Sigcomm'13) to building wireless backscatter systems that work reliably and address a key pain-point in the industry. Next, I will talk about how we shifted gears from working on wireless gesture recognition (WiSee, Mobicom'13) to addressing a medical need of millions of people in the United States that go undiagnosed from sleep apnea (ApneaApp, Mobisys'15) and our experience licensing our technology to a multi-national medical corporation. Finally, I will share my thoughts on how our research community can help us better navigate this chasm.",

                    "abstract": "This paper proposes 1Pipe, a novel communication abstraction that enables different receivers to process messages from senders in a consistent total order. More precisely, 1Pipe provides both unicast and scattering (i.e., a group of messages to different destinations) in a causally and totally ordered manner. 1Pipe provides a best effort service that delivers each message at most once, as well as a reliable service that guarantees delivery and provides restricted atomic delivery for each scattering. 1Pipe can simplify and accelerate many distributed applications, e.g., transactional key-value stores, log replication, and distributed data structures.We propose a scalable and efficient method to implement 1Pipe inside data centers. To achieve total order delivery in a scalable manner, 1Pipe separates the bookkeeping of order information from message forwarding, and distributes the work to each switch and host. 1Pipe aggregates order information using in-network computation at switches. This forms the \u201ccontrol plane\u201d of the system. On the \u201cdata plane\u201d, 1Pipe forwards messages in the network as usual and reorders them at the receiver based on the order information.Evaluation on a 32-server testbed shows that 1Pipe achieves scalable throughput (80M messages per second per host) and low latency (10\ud835\udf07s) with little CPU and network overhead. 1Pipe achieves linearly scalable throughput and low latency in transactional key-value store, TPC-C, remote data structures, and replication that outperforms traditional designs by 2\u223c20x.",

Other key design aspects of MPBond include a device/connection management scheme, a buffering strategy, a packet scheduling algorithm, and a policy framework tailored to MPBond's architecture. We install MPBond on commodity mobile devices and show how easy it is to configure the usage of MPBond for unmodified apps. We visualize the runtime behavior of MPBond to further illustrate its design. We also demonstrate the download time and energy reduction of file download, as well as the video streaming QoE improvement with MPBond.",

With an increasing number of antennas equipped in today's wireless devices, recent research has shown possibility of sub-meter level localization based only on the angle of arrival (AoA) of WiFi sig- nals. While most existing work provides promising median accu- racy, their tail performance however is usually far worse. We ob- serve from measurements that the root cause is due to unequal AoA estimation reliability. In some critical areas, a small variation in the channel state information of signals could introduce an extremely large AoA estimation error. With this observation, we propose UAT (Unequal Angle Tracking), a confidence-aware AoA-based localiza- tion system. We show that unequal reliability of AoA measures can be mathematically quantified, allowing a system to weigh the de- cisions of different APs according to their confidence. Our testbed evaluation shows that UAT's confidence-aware design provides reli- able decimeter level localization for around 90% of locations. UAT is especially effective for risky areas and can reduce their localiza- tion errors by 27.5%, as compared to reliability-oblivious designs.",

However, we find that it is remarkably inefficient for the existing design to scale up in prototyping: it requires one-by-one offline computation to obtain tags' operating parameters, in order to ensure orthogonality among subcarriers in the system; moreover, the tag hardware has to be dedicatedly modified offline before being assigned multiple subcarriers. The inefficiency is caused by the current analog frequency synthesis design for the tag. This paper proposes DigiScatter, an OFDMA backscatter system realizing digital frequency synthesis, which provides an efficient prototyping approach for large-scale OFDMA backscatter networks. In DigiScatter, we for the first time integrate IDFT into the tag design; such a simple but effective improvement enables the system to support high concurrency and flexible spectrum resource allocation through pure software configurations in an online manner. We build a prototype and conduct comprehensive experiments to validate our design. DigiScatter physically realizes 100 and 300 concurrent OFDMA backscatter transmissions in 2.4GHz and 900MHz respectively, and provides frequency synthesis capability for supporting 1019 concurrent transmissions.",

                    "abstract": "The resource usage model for millimeter wave bands has been the subject of considerable debate. The massive bandwidth, highly directional antennas, high penetration loss and susceptibility to shadowing in these bands suggest certain advantages to spectrum and infrastructure sharing. In particular, resources that are \"open\", such as unlicensed spectrum or a deployment of base stations open to all service providers, may offer greater gains in mmWave bands than at conventional cellular frequencies. However, even when sharing is technically beneficial (as recent research in this area suggests that it is), it may not be profitable. In this paper, both the technical and economic implications of resource sharing in millimeter wave networks are studied. Millimeter wave service is considered in the economic framework of a network good, and detailed network simulations are used to understand data rates, profit, and demand for millimeter wave service, with and without open resources. The results suggest that \"open\" deployments of neutral small cells that serve subscribers of any service provider encourage market entry by making it easier for networks to reach critical mass, more than \"open\" (unlicensed) spectrum would.",

While various efforts have been made toward saving both video transfer and display energy, they are independently designed in an ad-hoc way and thereby can cause some non-apparent yet critical performance issues. To fill in this gap, this paper presents a fundamentally new design by jointly considering the end-to-end pipeline from the initial video encoding to the final mobile display. In essence, we shift the classic R-D tradeoff that has governed streaming system designs for decades to a fresh rate-distortion-energy (R-D-E) tradeoff specifically tailored for mobile devices. We present RnB, a video bitrate and display brightness adaptation platform that is standard-compliant, backward compatible, and device-neutral in order to achieve the proposed R-D-E tradeoff. RnB is empowered by some new discovery about the inherent relationship among bitrate, display brightness, and video quality as well as by an control-theoretic formulation to dynamically adapt the bitrate and scale the display brightness. Experimental results based on real-time implementation show that RnB can achieve an average of 19% energy reduction with final video quality comparable to conventional R-D based schemes.",

By connecting cyberspace to the physical world, such interactive teleoperations are promising to improve remote education, virtual social interactions and online participatory activities. This work builds up a motion-controlled robotic arm framework and proposes to verify who is controlling the robotic arm by examining the robotic arm's behavior. We show that a robotic arm's motion inherits its human controller's behavioral biometric in interactive control scenarios. Furthermore, we derive the unique robotic motion features to capture the user's behavioral biometric embedded in the robot motions and develop learning-based algorithms to verify the robotic arm user. Extensive experiments show that our system achieves high accuracy to distinguish users while using the robot's behaviors.",

Starting in 2009, the OVS design split its code between tightly coupled kernel and userspace components. This split was necessary at the time for performance, but it caused maintainability problems that persist today. In addition, in-kernel packet processing is now much slower than newer options.To solve the problems caused by the user/kernel split, OVS must adopt a new architecture. We describe two possibilities that we explored, but did not adopt, one because it gives up compatibility with drivers and tools that are important to virtual data center operators, the other because it performs poorly. Instead, we endorse a third approach, based on a new Linux socket type called AF_XDP, which solves the maintainability problem in a compatible, performant way. The new code is already merged into the mainstream OVS repository. We include a thorough performance evaluation and a collection of lessons learned.",

                    "abstract": "Vital signs are crucial indicators for human health, and researchers are studying contact-free alternatives to existing wearable vital signs sensors. Unfortunately, most of these designs demand a subject human body to be relatively static, rendering them very inconvenient to adopt in practice where body movements occur frequently. In particular, radio-frequency (RF) based contact-free sensing can be severely affected by body movements that overwhelm vital signs. To this end, we introduce MoVi-Fi as a motion-robust vital signs monitoring system, capable of recovering fine-grained vital signs waveform in a contact-free manner. Being a pure software system, MoVi-Fi can be built on top of virtually any commercial-grade radars. What inspires our design is that RF reflections caused by vital signs, albeit weak, do not totally disappear but are composited with other motion-incurred reflections in a nonlinear manner. As nonlinear blind source separation is inherently hard, MoVi-Fi innovatively employs deep contrastive learning to tackle the problem; this self-supervised method requires no ground truth in training, and it exploits contrastive signal features to distinguish vital signs from body movements. Our experiments with 12 subjects and 80hour data demonstrate that MoVi-Fi accurately recovers vital signs waveform under severe body movements.",

It offers an alternative to the dominant single-carrier paradigm, and shows early signs of success through the operational Project Fi by Google. In this paper, we study the important, yet largely unexplored, problem of inter-carrier switching for multi-carrier access. We show that policy conflicts can arise between inter- and intra-carrier switching, resulting in oscillations among carriers in the worst case akin to BGP looping. We derive the conditions under which such oscillations occur for three categories of popular policy, and validate them with Project Fi whenever possible. We provide practical guidelines to ensure loop-freedom and assess them via trace-driven emulations.",

Nevertheless, running heavy 3D Android games on AOVB incurs considerable overhead of full virtualization, thus often leading to unsatisfactory smoothness. To tackle this issue, we present DAOW, a commercial game-oriented Android emulator implementing the idea of direct Android emulation, which eliminates the overhead of full virtualization by providing foreign Android binaries with direct access to the domestic PC hardware through Windows kernel interfaces. In this demo, we will demonstrate that DAOW essentially outperforms traditional AOVB-based emulators in terms of running smoothness, game startup time, and memory usage.",

One of 5G's key objective is to support a variety of use cases with different Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Slicing is a key part of 5G that allows operators to provide a tailored set of resources to different use cases in order to meet their SLOs. Existing works focus on slicing in the frontend or the C-RAN. However, slicing is missing in the fronthaul network that connects the frontend to the C-RAN. This leads to over-provisioning in the fronthaul and the C-RAN, and also limits the scalability of the network.In this paper, we design and implement Fronthaul Slicing Architecture (FSA), which to the best of our knowledge, is the first slicing architecture for the fronthaul network. FSA runs in the switch dataplane and uses information from the wireless schedule to identify the slice of a fronthaul data packet at line-rate. It enables multipoint-to-multipoint routing as well as packet prioritization to provide multiplexing gains in the fronthaul and the C-RAN, making the system more scalable. Our testbed evaluation using scaled-up LTE traces shows that FSA can support accurate multipoint-to-multipoint routing for 80 Gbps of fronthaul traffic. Further, the slice-aware packet scheduling enabled by FSA's packet prioritization reduces the 95th percentile Flowlet Completion Times (FCT) of latency-sensitive traffic by up to 4 times.",

This motivates a congestion control \"scavenger\" that voluntarily yields to higher-priority applications, thus improving overall user experience. However, the existing scavenger protocol, LEDBAT, often fails to yield, has performance shortcomings, and requires a codebase separate from other transport protocols.We present PCC Proteus, a new congestion controller that can behave as an effective scavenger or primary protocol. Proteus incorporates several novel ideas to ensure that it yields to primary flows while still obtaining high performance, including using latency deviation as a signal of competition, and techniques for noise tolerance in dynamic environments. By extending the existing PCC utility framework, Proteus also allows applications to specify a flexible utility function that, in addition to scavenger and primary modes, allows choice of hybrid modes between the two, better capturing application needs. Extensive emulation and real-world evaluation show that Proteus is capable of both being a much more effective scavenger than LEDBAT, and of acting as a high performance primary protocol.

                    "abstract": "In recent years, convolutional networks have demonstrated unprecedented performance in the image restoration task of super-resolution (SR). SR entails the upscaling of a single low-resolution image in order to meet application-specific image quality demands and plays a key role in mobile devices. To comply with privacy regulations and reduce the overhead of cloud computing, executing SR models locally on-device constitutes a key alternative approach. Nevertheless, the excessive compute and memory requirements of SR workloads pose a challenge in mapping SR networks on resource-constrained mobile platforms. This work presents MobiSR, a novel framework for performing efficient super-resolution on-device. Given a target mobile platform, the proposed framework considers popular model compression techniques and traverses the design space to reach the highest performing trade-off between image quality and processing speed. At run time, a novel scheduler dispatches incoming image patches to the appropriate model-engine pair based on the patch's estimated upscaling difficulty in order to meet the required image quality with minimum processing latency. Quantitative evaluation shows that the proposed framework yields on-device SR designs that achieve an average speedup of 2.13x over highly-optimized parallel difficulty-unaware mappings and 4.79x over highly-optimized single compute engine implementations.",

Although the fingerprint technology is a go-to biometric solution in high-impact applications (e.g., smart-phone security, monetary transactions and international-border verification), the existing fingerprint scanners are vulnerable to spoofing attacks via fake-finger and cannot be employed across smart devices (e.g., wearables) due to hardware constraints. We propose SonicPrint that extends fingerprint identification beyond smartphones to any smart device without the need for traditional fingerprint scanners. SonicPrint builds on the fingerprint-induced sonic effect (FiSe) caused by a user swiping his fingertip on smart devices and the resulting property, i.e., different users' fingerprint would result in distinct FiSe. As the first exploratory study, extensive experiments verify the above property with 31 participants over four different swipe actions on five different types of smart devices with even partial fingerprints. SonicPrint achieves up to a 98% identification accuracy on smartphone and an equal-error-rate (EER) less than 3% for smartwatch and headphones. We also examine and demonstrate the resilience of SonicPrint against fingerprint phantoms and replay attacks. A key advantage of SonicPrint is that it leverages the already existing microphones in smart devices, requiring no hardware modifications. Compared with other biometrics including physiological patterns and passive sensing, SonicPrint is a low-cost, privacy-oriented and secure approach to identify users across smart devices of unique form-factors.",

In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study of multipath for mobile settings, focusing on MPTCP, with the goal of developing key insights for evolving the mobile multipath design. First, we conduct to our knowledge the most in-depth and the longest user trial of mobile multipath that focuses not only on MPTCP performance, but also on cross-layer interactions. Second, we identify a new research problem of multipath-aware CDN server selection. We demonstrate its real-world importance and provide recommendations. Third, our measurement findings lead us to design and implement a flexible software architecture for mobile multipath called MPFlex, which strategically employs multiplexing to improve multipath performance (by up to 63% for short-lived flows). MPFlex decouples the high-level scheduling algorithm and the low-level OS protocol implementation, and enables developers to flexibly plug-in new multipath features. MPFlex also provides an ideal vantage point for flexibly realizing user-specified multipath policies and is friendly to middleboxes.",

A typical IoT application usually consists of three essential parts: the device side, the cloud side, and the client side. The development of a complete IoT application is very difficult for non-expert developers because it involves drastically different technologies and complex interactions between different sides. Unlike traditional IoT development platforms which use separate approaches for these three sides, we present TinyLink 2.0, an integrated IoT development approach with a single coherent language. It achieves high expressiveness for diverse IoT applications by an enhanced IFTTT rule design and a virtual sensor mechanism which helps developers express application logic with machine learning. Moreover, TinyLink 2.0 optimizes the IoT application performance by using both static and dynamic optimizers, especially for resource-constrained IoT devices. We implement TinyLink 2.0 and evaluate it with eight case studies, a user study, and a detailed evaluation of the proposed programming language as well as the performance optimizers. Results show that TinyLink 2.0 can speed up IoT development significantly compared with existing approaches from both industry and academia, while still achieving high expressiveness.",

However with the technologies advancement, it seems that intelligent devices will invisibly be embedded in our life in few years. Enormous amounts of data need be exchanged every seconds. It calls for a seamless effect and easily interpretable communicating architecture. The research proposal will try to address some challenges and possible path in IoT enabled smarthome. It focuses primarily on two categories. Firstly, devices in IoT field is always distributed. So, there is a distributed IoT services architecture instead of traditional control-center solution. However, those devices are also limited in a certain area (such as a home local network). In order to reduce delay and burden, those distributed devices collect context information though a self-organizing broadcast network, and determine their next action based on that context data. Secondly, using Docker (a lightweight hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic container) to package services. In our smarthome network, IoT services are distributed across different home electronics. Docker shields all the differences, so that we can quickly deploy and update module in the smarthome network after purchasing new electronics.",

                    "abstract": "Although flash cells wear out, a typical SSD has enough cells and sufficiently sophisticated firmware that its lifetime generally exceeds the expected lifetime of its host system. Even under heavy use, SSDs last for years and can be replaced upon failure. On a smartphone, in contrast, the hardware is more limited and we show that, under heavy use, one can easily, and more quickly, wear out smartphone flash storage. Consequently, a simple, unprivileged, malicious application can render a smartphone unbootable (\"bricked\") in a few weeks with no warning signs to the user. This bleak result becomes more worrisome when considering the fact that smartphone users generally believe it is safe to try out new applications. To combat this problem, we study the I/O behavior of a wide range of Android applications. We find that high-volume write bursts exist, yet none of the applications we checked sustains an average write rate that is high enough to damage the device (under reasonable usage assumptions backed by the literature). We therefore propose a rate-limiting algorithm for write activity that (1) prevents such attacks, (2) accommodates \"normal\" bursts, and (3) ensures that the smartphone drive lifetime is longer than a preconfigured lower bound (i.e., its warranty). In terms of user experience, our design only requires that, in the worst case of an app that issues continuous, unsustainable, and unusual writes, the user decides whether to shorten the phone's life or rate limit the problematic app.",

To maximize the safety and efficiency of first responders, deployment of wireless sensors are of utmost importance, as sensor nodes can provide sensing information as well as location information. We analyze the issues and challenges that need to be tackled for high accuracy localization of sensor nodes in such environments, and then propose a system that we plan to develop in the near future.",

A typical mechanism to interface with a personal device is via a touch screen, in which users use their fingertip or stylus to scroll, type, select, or otherwise control device usage. Touch-based techniques, however, can become restrictive or inconvenient under a variety of scenarios. For example, personal devices such as phones or tablets are continuously increasing in size, making one-handed interaction difficult because one cannot easily hold the phone and touch the screen (with the thumb) at the same time with one hand. Therefore, in this demo, we present a new technique to interact with personal devices in which the screen and touch screen interactions can adapt to a user's grip or current touch constraints.",

In this paper, given a partially shared deployment (PSD) of subchannels between macro BS (MBS) and the small cell base stations (SCBSs), the DC uplink (UL) resource allocation problem is formulated. Given such PSD system, the optimum number of subchannels that can be allocated for SCBSs for a DC user in UL are computed. The computation of MBS and SCBSs thresholds for selection of DC user in downlink is also presented. Further, a framework to select the operating point based on energy, throughput, user density, and SCBSs density is presented.",

                    "abstract": "Radio frequency (RF) technologies have achieved a great success in data communication. In recent years, pervasive RF signals are further exploited for sensing; RF sensing has since attracted attentions from both academia and industry. Existing developments mainly employ commodity Wi-Fi hardware or rely on sophisticated SDR platforms. While promising in many aspects, there still remains a gap between lab prototypes and real-life deployments. On one hand, due to its narrow bandwidth and communication-oriented design, Wi-Fi sensing offers a coarse sensing granularity and its performance is very unstable in harsh real-world environments. On the other hand, SDR-based designs may hardly be adopted in practice due to its large size and high cost. To this end, we propose, design, and implement Octopus, a compact and flexible wideband MIMO sensing platform, built using commercial-grade low-power impulse radio. Octopus provides a standalone and fully programmable RF sensing solution; it allows for quick algorithm design and application development, and it specifically leverages the wideband radio to achieve a competent and robust performance in practice. We evaluate the performance of Octopus via micro-benchmarking, and further demonstrate its applicability using representative RF sensing applications, including passive localization, vibration sensing, and human/object imaging.",

To detect face liveness, AIME creates multiple image patterns on the authentication screen as a challenge, then captures meaningful corneal specular reflection responses from user's eyes using the front camera, and analyzes the reflective pattern images using various lightweight Machine Learning (ML) techniques under a subsecond level delay (200 ms). We demonstrate that AIME can detect various attacks, including digital images displayed on the phone or tablet, printed paper images, 2D paper masks, videos, 3D silicon masks, and 3D facial models using VR. AIME liveness detection can be applied for various contactless biometric authentication accurately and efficiently without any costly extra sensors.",

A key component in a multipath system such as MPTCP is the scheduler, which determines how to distribute the traffic over multiple paths. In this paper, we propose DEMS, a new multipath scheduler aiming at reducing the data chunk download time. DEMS consists of three key design decisions: (1) being aware of the chunk boundary and strategically decoupling the paths for chunk delivery, (2) ensuring simultaneous subflow completion at the receiver side, and (3) allowing a path to trade a small amount of redundant data for performance. We have implemented DEMS on smartphones and evaluated it over both emulated and real cellular/WiFi networks. DEMS is robust to diverse network conditions and brings significant performance boost compared to the default MPTCP scheduler (e.g., median download time reduction of 33%--48% for fetching files and median loading time reduction of 6%--43% for fetching web pages), and even more benefits compared to other state-of-the-art schedulers.",

However, a key missing piece remains: fault tolerance. This is especially critical as the network is no longer stateless and pure endpoint recovery does not suffice. In this paper, we design and implement RedPlane, a fault-tolerant state store for stateful in-switch applications. This provides in-switch applications consistent access to their state, even if the switch they run on fails or traffic is rerouted to an alternative switch. We address key challenges in devising a practical, provably correct replication protocol and implementing it in the switch data plane. Our evaluations show that RedPlane incurs negligible overhead and enables end-to-end applications to rapidly recover from switch failures.",

In particular, an autonomous vehicle recognizes objects and the surrounding situation using the CNN models. CNN models for image classification are trained using clear image dataset, so they are not robust to grayscale images or noise-intensive data. Therefore, there is a risk of an accident because the quality of the input image drops rapidly during night driving. The region that is revealed by the headlight can have colors, but in the shaded area it has a brightness that is not enough to get color values. We intend to increase the safety of autonomous driving by coloring this region of interest(ROI).",

Our experiments demonstrate that the large asymmetry in the channel access methodologies employed by WiFi and LTE (carrier sensing/notification in WiFi, energy sensing alone in LTE-U), can result LTE-U completely blocking WiFi transmissions, and causing significant degradation to either technologies from collisions.We address this critical sensing asymmetry with Ultron, a LTE-WiFi co-existence solution that integrates WiFi's carrier sensing and notification mechanisms into LTE, without any modifications to the LTE PHY standard. Ultron operates at the LTE base station and consists of two key components: (a) WiFi embedding that embeds appropriate data into the LTE-subframes through an intelligent reverse-engineering of the LTE PHY, so as to realize a WiFi PLCP preamble-header transmission over the air directly using the LTE PHY; and (b) scalable WiFi sensing that employs a single WiFi interface and maximizes its carrier sensing benefits to all the unlicensed channels operating at the LTE node. Our evaluations demonstrate that Ultron can increase the WiFi and LTE throughput by 5x and 6x respectively, resulting from a sharp reduction in LTE-WiFi interference.",

This imposes a specification burden on the programmer, while at the same time failing to guarantee that bugs will not be inserted at runtime by faulty controllers.We present bf4, a novel verification approach for P4 programs that uses a mix of static verification, code changes and runtime checks to ensure that the deployed P4 program is bug free. To achieve this, bf4 uses static analysis to find all possible bugs in the P4 program; for each possible bug, bf4 attempts to find predicates that, when applied to table rules inserted by the controller, make that bug unreachable. If such predicates do not exist, bf4 can change the P4 code and re-run the procedure above.We applied bf4 to a wide range of P4 programs; for all these, bf4 is able to generate controller assertions and propose fixes that guarantee no controller-induced bug is reachable. At runtime, bf4 checks that the controller does not insert faulty rules; when it does, it throws an exception which helps troubleshoot the bug.",

While there have been numerous reports on smartphone overheating, a systematic measurement and user experience study on the thermal aspect of smartphones is missing. Using thermal imaging cameras, we measure and analyze the temperatures of various smartphones running diverse application workloads such as voice calling, video recording, video chatting, and 3D online gaming. Our experiments show that running popular applications such as video chat, could raise the smartphone's surface temperature to over 50$^circ$C in only 10 minutes, which could easily cause thermal pain to users. Recent ubiquitous scenarios such as augmented reality and mobile deep learning also have considerable thermal issues. We then perform a user study to examine when the users perceive heat discomfort from the smartphones and how they react to overheating. Most of our user study participants reported considerable thermal discomfort while playing a mobile game, and that overheating disrupted interaction flows. With this in mind, we devise a smartphone surface temperature prediction model, by using only system statistics and internal sensor values. Our evaluation showed high prediction accuracy with root-mean-square errors of less than 2$^circ$C. We discuss several insights from our findings and recommendations for user experience, OS design, and developer support for better user-thermal interactions.",

Contrary to popular view, 5G is not expected to be anchored on a single disruptive technology but rather supported by an amalgamation of multiple technologies. In essence, it is an evolution of several key technical advancements, whose synergy is expected to revolutionize the heterogeneity of use cases that can be \"simultaneously\" enabled by a single network. Such use cases range from throughput-focused mobile broadband (Gigabit peak rates) to latency/reliability-focused mission critical (e.g. augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving) and density-focused massive connection (IoT) services. While physical layer advancements in the form of New Radio (NR) are an integral part of 5G, realizing the diverse use cases envisioned, will equally require innovation and flexible orchestration of its access, network and computing layers as well. This tutorial will provide an overview of some of these innovative ingredients that will constitute 5G, from the perspective of not just radio access network, but also core network and services/applications.",

Unfortunately, the key aspects of NB-IoT networks, such as radio access performance and power consumption have not been well-understood due to lack of effective tools and closed nature of operational cellular infrastructure. In this paper, we develop NB-Scope - the first hardware NB-IoT diagnostic tool that supports fine-grained fusion of power and protocol traces. We then conduct a large-scale field measurement study consisting of 30 nodes deployed at over 1,200 locations in 3 regions during a period of three months. Our in-depth analysis of the collected 49 GB traces showed that NB-IoT nodes yield significantly imbalanced energy consumption in the wild, up to a ratio of 75:1, which may lead to short battery lifetime and frequent network partition. Such a high performance variance can be attributed to several key factors including diverse network coverage levels, long tail power profile, and excessive control message repetitions. We then explore the optimization of NB-IoT base station settings on a software-defined eNodeB testbed, and suggest several important design aspects that can be considered by future NB-IoT specifications and chipsets.",

However, current Medium Access Control (MAC) layers filter incoming frames based on destination addresses, not content. The data-centric network community has resorted to MAC broadcast, with high and greatly varying frame loss rates. We propose V-MAC, a data-centric MAC layer that filters frames by content. It supports one to many multicast at MAC level, and ensures a uniform and controllable small frame loss rate across all receivers, despite their varying reception qualities. We have created a V-MAC prototype using Raspberry Pis and WiFi dongles. Experiments under extremely noisy environment show that it reduces frame loss from 50% (broadcast) to less than 10%, and consistently among multiple receivers.",

The graphics pipeline requires a close relationship between the CPU and the GPU to ensure energy efficiency and the user's quality of experience (QoE). Our preliminary analysis showed that the current techniques employed to achieve energy efficiency in the Android graphics pipeline are not optimized especially in the frame generation process. In this paper, we aim to improve the energy efficiency of the Android graphics pipeline without degrading the user's QoE. To achieve this goal, we studied the internals of the Android graphics pipeline and observed the energy inefficiency in the existing governing framework of the CPU and GPU. Based on the findings, we propose three techniques for addressing energy inefficiency: (1) aggressively capping the maximum CPU frequency, (2) lowering the CPU frequency by raising the GPU minimum frequency, and (3) allocating the frame rendering-related threads in the energy-efficient CPU cores. These techniques are integrated into a single governing framework, called the GFX Governor, and implemented in the newest Android-based smartphones. Experimental results show that without hampering the user's QoE the average energy consumption of Nexus 6P, Pixel XL, and Pixel 2 XL is reduced at the device level by 24.2%, 18.6%, and 13.7%, respectively, for the 60 chosen applications. We also analyzed the efficacy of the proposed technique in comparison with the state-of-the-art Energy-Aware Scheduling (EAS) implemented in the latest smartphone.",

Acoustic sensing for VUI is designed to sense all acoustic objects; however, the existing VUI mechanism can only offer low-quality speech sensing. This is due to the audible and inaudible interference from complex ambient noise that limits the performance of VUI by causing denial-of-service (DoS) of user requests. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to enable noise-resistant speech sensing in VUI for executing critical tasks with superior efficiency and precision in robust environments. To this end, we investigate the feasibility of employing radio-frequency signals, such as millimeter wave (mmWave) for sensing the noise-resistant voice of an individual. We first perform an in-depth study behind the rationale of voice generation and resulting vocal vibrations. From the obtained insights, we presentWaveEar, an end-to-end noise-resistant speech sensing system.WaveEar comprises a low-cost mmWave probe to localize the position of the speaker among multiple people and direct the mmWave signals towards the near-throat region of the speaker for sensing his/her vocal vibrations. The received signal, containing the speech information, is fed to our novel deep neural network for recovering the voice through exhaustive extraction. Our experimental evaluation under real-world scenarios with 21 participants shows the effectiveness ofWaveEar to precisely infer the noise-resistant voice and enable a pervasive VUI in modern electronic devices.",

Over two-thirds of the world's population have mobile phones, yet less than half are connected to the Internet [23]. Organizations helping disadvantaged populations often rely on mobile devices as their primary computing resource because of their availability in resource-constrained contexts. However, to reach under-served populations, mobile applications often operate in areas with no connectivity or challenged network environments. Unfortunately, many mobile application frameworks are generally not well-suited for long periods of disconnected data collection and management. Furthermore, mobile application frameworks are generally aimed at users with significant technical skills and resources. In this paper, we discuss our experiences building, deploying, and refining the Open Data Kit (ODK) 2.0 tool suite. ODK 2.0 is a modular application framework that facilitates organizations with limited technical capacity to build application-specific information services for use in disconnected environments. We discuss ODK 2.0's flexible abstractions that enable users of varying technical skill levels to create customizable mobile data management solutions. We present ODK 2.0 case studies involving multiple organizations and discuss lessons learned from building a service-based mobile application framework for disconnected data management.",

                    "abstract": "Internet-of-Things devices often collect and transmit sensitive information like camera footage, health monitoring data, or whether someone is home. These devices protect data in transit with end-to-end encryption, typically using TLS connections between devices and associated cloud services. But these TLS connections also prevent device owners from observing what their own devices are saying about them. Unlike in traditional Internet applications, where the end user controls one end of a connection (e.g., their web browser) and can observe its communication, Internet-of-Things vendors typically control the software in both the device and the cloud. As a result, owners have no way to audit the behavior of their own devices, leaving them little choice but to hope that these devices are transmitting only what they should.This paper presents TLS--Rotate and Release (TLS-RaR), a system that allows device owners (e.g., consumers, security researchers, and consumer watchdogs) to authorize devices, called auditors, to decrypt and verify recent TLS traffic without compromising future traffic. Unlike prior work, TLS-RaR requires no changes to TLS's wire format or cipher suites, and it allows the device's owner to conduct a surprise inspection of recent traffic, without prior notice to the device that its communications will be audited.",

State-of-the-art solutions for vehicle sensing may not build accurate and complete knowledge of all vehicle trajectories. In order to fill the gap, this paper proposes VeTrac, a comprehensive system that employs widely deployed traffic cameras as a sensing network to trace vehicle movements and reconstruct their trajectories in a large scale. VeTrac fuses mobility correlation and vision-based analysis to reduce uncertainties in identifying vehicles. A graph convolution process is employed to maintain the identity consistency across different camera observations, and a self-training process is invoked when aligning with the urban road network to reconstruct vehicle trajectories with confidence. Extensive experiments with real-world data input of over 7 million vehicle snapshots from over one thousand traffic cameras demonstrate that VeTrac achieves 98% accuracy for simple expressway scenario and 89% accuracy for complex urban environment. The achieved accuracy outperforms alternative solutions by 32% for expressway scenario and by 59% for complex urban environment.",

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to locate spectrum offenders using crowdsourcing. In such a participatory sensing system, privacy and bandwidth concerns preclude distributed sensing devices from reporting raw signal samples to a central agency; instead, devices would be limited to measurements of received power. However, this limitation enables a smart attacker to evade localization by simultaneously transmitting from multiple infected devices. Existing localization methods are insufficient or incapable of locating multiple sources when the powers from each source cannot be separated at the receivers. In this paper, we first propose a simple and efficient method that simultaneously locates multiple transmitters using the received power measurements from the selected devices. Second, we build sampling approaches to select sensing devices required for localization. Next, we enhance our sampling to also take into account incentives for participation in crowdsourcing. We experimentally evaluate our localization framework under a variety of settings and find that we are able to localize multiple sources transmitting simultaneously with reasonably high accuracy in a timely manner.",

                    "abstract": "Backscatter communication, in which data is conveyed through reflecting excitation signals, has been advocated as a promising green technology for Internet of Things (IoT). Existing backscatter solutions however are mostly centralized, relying on a single excitation source, typically within one hop. Though recent works have demonstrated the viability of multi-hop backscatter, the excitation signal remains centralized, which attenuates quickly and fundamentally limits the communication scope. For long-range and high-quality communication, distributed excitations are expected and also naturally available as ambient signals (WiFi, BLE, cellular, FM, light, sound, etc.), albeit not being explored for boosting nearby tags for relaying.Given the existence of distributed excitation, a relay tag has to be decodable, i.e., be able to first decode its previous hop's information and then backscatter to the next hop with a boost from a nearby excitation whenever possible. In this paper, we present DecRel, a decodable tag relay solution towards a backscatter sensor mesh for universal and scalable deployment with distributed excitation. DecRel is also an innovative wireless sensor architecture for simultaneous sensing and relay. It incorporates a relay path that uses envelope detection for decoding, and a sensing path that converts its own sensor data into a baseband for amplitude-demodulation by the next hop tag's relay path. The two paths then backscatter their respective data to different frequencies to avoid interference. We have built a working DecRel tag prototype using FPGA, discrete components, and off-the-shelf analog devices. Our experiments show superior performance of DecRel as compared with the state-of-the-art non-decodable tag relay: specifically, a digital baseband's multi-hop throughput of up to 40Kbps (200x improvement), an analog baseband's equivalent multi-hop throughput of up to 768Kbps (3000x improvement), and a tag-to-tag distance of up to 4.8m (10x improvement) with a hop count of up to 6. DecRel tag consumes 337.9\u03bcW of power using IC design.",

Such cellular IoT services share the existing cellular network architecture with non-IoT (e.g., smartphone) ones. When they are newly integrated into the cellular network, new security vulnerabilities may happen from imprudent integration. In this work, we explore the security vulnerabilities of the cellular IoT from both system-integrated and service-integrated aspects. We discover five vulnerabilities spanning cellular standard design defects, network operation slips, and IoT device implementation flaws. Threateningly, they allow an adversary to remotely identify IP addresses and phone numbers assigned to cellular IoT devices and launch data/text spamming attacks against them. We experimentally validate these vulnerabilities and attacks with three major U.S. IoT carriers. The attack evaluation result shows that the adversary can raise an IoT data bill by up to $226 with less than 120 MB spam traffic and increase an IoT text bill at a rate of $5 per second; moreover, cellular IoT devices may suffer from denial of IoT services. We finally propose, prototype, and evaluate recommended solutions.",

On the other hand, legacy 802.11ac/n links yield much lower rates but are robust even under dynamic scenarios. In this work, we explore using Multipath TCP (MPTCP) to engage both 802.11ad and 802.11ac interfaces simultaneously for performance speed-up and improved reliability. We show that vanilla MPTCP achieves these goals under static conditions but often results in performance worse than using the faster interface alone under dynamic scenarios. We then design and implement AMuSe, a new MPTCP scheduler that allows MPTCP to perform near-optimally under all scenarios.",

This is particularly the case in rural and undeserved regions where providing Internet access infrastructure is challenging and expensive. To this end, we present demonstration of WhiteHaul [5], a low-cost hybrid cross-layer aggregation system for TV White Space (TVWS) based backhaul. WhiteHaul features a custom-designed frequency conversion substrate that efficiently handles multiple noncontiguous chunks of TVWS spectrum using multiple low-cost COTS 802.11n/ac cards but with a single antenna. At the software layer, WhiteHaul uses MPTCP as a link-level tunnel abstraction to efficiently aggregate multiple chunks of the TVWS spectrum via a novel uncoupled, cross-layer congestion control algorithm. This demo illustrates the unique features of the WhiteHaul system based on a prototype implementation employing a modified version of MPTCP Linux Kernel and a custom-designed conversion substrate. Using this prototype, we highlight the performance of the WhiteHaul system under various configurations and network conditions.",

                    "abstract": "Global Positioning System is a widely adopted localization technique. With the increasing demand for small satellites, the need for a low-power GPS for satellites is also increasing. To enable many state-of-the-art applications, the exact position of the satellites is necessary. However, building low-power GPS receivers which operate in low earth orbit pose significant challenges. This is mainly due to the high speed (~7.8 km/s) of small satellites. While duty-cycling the receiver is a possible solution, the high relative Doppler shift between the GPS satellites and the small satellite contributes to the increase in Time To First Fix (TTFF), thus increasing the energy consumption. Further, if the GPS receiver is tumbling along with the small satellite on which it is mounted, longer TTFF may lead to no GPS fix due to disorientation of the receiver antenna. In this paper, we elucidate the design of a low-cost, low-power GPS receiver for small satellite applications. We also propose an energy optimization algorithm called F3to improve the TTFF which is the main contributor to the energy consumption during cold start. With simulations and in-orbit evaluation from a launched nanosatellite with our \u03bcGPS and high-end GPS simulators, we show that up to 96.16% of energy savings (consuming only ~ 1/25th energy compared to the state of the art) can be achieved using our algorithm without compromising much (~10 m) on the navigation accuracy. The TTFF achieved is at most 33 s.",

As users store more and more photos in the cloud, significant privacy concerns arise because even a single compromise of a user's credentials give attackers unfettered access to all of the user's photos. We have created Easy Secure Photos (ESP) to enable users to protect their photos on cloud photo services such as Google Photos. ESP introduces a new client-side encryption architecture that includes a novel format-preserving image encryption algorithm, an encrypted thumbnail display mechanism, and a usable key management system. ESP encrypts image data such that the result is still a standard format image like JPEG that is compatible with cloud photo services. ESP efficiently generates and displays encrypted thumbnails for fast and easy browsing of photo galleries from trusted user devices. ESP's key management makes it simple to authorize multiple user devices to view encrypted image content via a process similar to device pairing, but using the cloud photo service as a QR code communication channel. We have implemented ESP in a popular Android photos app for use with Google Photos and demonstrate that it is easy to use and provides encryption functionality transparently to users, maintains good interactive performance and image quality while providing strong privacy guarantees, and retains the sharing and storage benefits of Google Photos without any changes to the cloud service.",

Our system requires no modification to the existing light infrastructure and uses unmodulated ambient light as sensing medium. We achieve this by designing a sensing mechanism that uses solar cells to achieve sub-\u03bcWs of power consumption. Further, we devise an ultra-low power backscatter based transmission mechanism we call Scatterlight that transmits digital readings without incurring the processing and computation overhead of existing sensors. Based on these principles we build a preliminary prototype. Our initial results demonstrate its ability to sense and communicate three hand gestures at 20 \u03bcWs of power.",

Once granted a permission, Android will always allow an app to access the resource until the user manually revokes the app's permission. Prior work has proposed extensible plugin frameworks, but they have struggled to support flexible authorization and isolate apps and plugins from each other. In this paper, we propose DALF, a framework for extensible permissions plugins that provides both flexibility and isolation. The insight underlying DALF is that permissions plugins should be treated as apps themselves. This approach allows plugins to maintain state and access system resources such as a device's location while being restricted by Android's process-isolation mechanisms. Experiments with microbenchmarks and case studies with real third-party apps show promising results: plugins are easy to develop and impose acceptable overhead for most resources.",

However, existing encounter-based communication (EbC) systems are limited to communication among participants that share a direct encounter. This work is inspired by two insights: (1) encounters also enable group communication among devices connected by paths in the encounter graph that is contextual, spontaneous, secure, and privacy-preserving; and (2) addressing communication partners using encounter closures subject to causal, spatial, and temporal constraints enables powerful new forms of group communication. We present the design of enClosure, a service providing group communication based on encounter closures for mobile and IoT applications, and a prototype implementation for Android and the Microsoft Embedded Social Cloud platform. Using real-world traces, we show that enClosure provides a privacy-preserving, secure platform for a wide range of group communication applications ranging from connecting attendees of a large event to disseminating health risk warnings and tracing missing persons.",

                    "abstract": "In recent years, biometric techniques (e.g., fingerprint or iris) are increasingly integrated into mobile devices to offer security advantages over traditional practices (e.g., passwords and PINs) due to their ease of use in user authentication. However, existing biometric systems are with controversy: once divulged, they are compromised forever - no one can grow a new fingerprint or iris. This work explores a truly cancelable brain-based biometric system for mobile platforms (e.g., smart headwear). Specifically, we present a new psychophysiological protocol via non-volitional brain response for trustworthy mobile authentication, with an application example of smart headwear. Particularly, we address the following research challenges in mobile biometrics with a theoretical and empirical combined manner: (1) how to generate reliable brain responses with sophisticated visual stimuli; (2) how to acquire the distinct brain response and analyze unique features in the mobile platform; (3) how to reset and change brain biometrics when the current biometric credential is divulged. To evaluate the proposed solution, we conducted a pilot study and achieved an f -score accuracy of 95.46% and equal error rate (EER) of 2.503%, thereby demonstrating the potential feasibility of neurofeedback based biometrics for smart headwear. Furthermore, we perform the cancelability study and the longitudinal study, respectively, to show the effectiveness and usability of our new proposed mobile biometric system. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first in-depth research study on truly cancelable brain biometrics for secure mobile authentication.",

However, the current multi-layer constellation based solutions have drawbacks in terms of availability, latency, openness, etc. The key contribution in this work is the study of an efficient control framework, which logically consists of two parts: entity part and overlay part. The entity part is a novel heterogeneous single-layer LEO satellite network, while the overlay part implements a virtualized overlay network. We have implemented a lightweight prototype of our framework and compared it with a GEO satellite based solution (i.e. OpenSAN). We demonstrate proof-of-concept that our framework performs better than OpenSAN with respect to control latency and avoids potential system bottleneck.",

This attack is difficult to detect because 1) the attacker is a passive man-in-the-middle to relay control messages between the compromised ports on SDN switches, and 2) such messages are genuine for the SDN switches and controller. This poster proposes Silent Relay Detector (SRD) that tailor- makes the SDN control messages to be processed normally by authentic switches but to make the attacker malfunction. The SRD implementation and experiment reveal how the silent relay attack is detected and fake link injection is prohibited ingeniously.",

Social support and CDC have an impact on health behavior and well-being or emotions in couples' dyadic management of diabetes in daily life. Hence, understanding dyadic interactions in-situ in chronic disease management could inform behavioral interventions to help the dyadic management of chronic diseases. It is however not clear how well social support and CDC can be assessed in daily life among couples who are managing chronic diseases. In this ongoing work, we describe the development of DyMand, a novel open-source mobile and wearable system for ambulatory assessment of couples' dyadic management of chronic diseases. Our first prototype is used in the context of diabetes mellitus Type II. Additionally, we briefly describe our experience deploying the prototype in two pre-pilot tests with five subjects and our plans for future deployments.",

Existing parallel decoding mechanisms, however, assume that signals of the tags are highly stable, and hence may not perform optimally in the naturally dynamic backscatter systems. This paper introduces FlipTracer, a practical system that achieves highly reliable parallel decoding even in hostile channel conditions. FlipTracer is designed with a key insight: although the collided signal is time-varying and irregular, transitions between signals' combined states follow highly stable probabilities, which offers important clues for identifying the collided signals, and provides us with an opportunity to decode the collided signals without relying on stable signals. Motivated by this observation, we propose a graphical model, called one-flip-graph (OFG), to capture the transition pattern of collided signals, and design a reliable approach to construct the OFG in a manner robust to the diversity in backscatter systems. Then FlipTracer can resolve the collided signals by tracking the OFG. We have implemented FlipTracer and evaluated its performance with extensive experiments across a wide variety of scenarios. Our experimental results have shown that FlipTracer achieves a maximum aggregated throughput that approaches 2 Mbps, which is 6x higher than the state-of-the-art.",

TyrLoc only uses a single RF Chain to switch on each antenna in an antenna array within the coherence time asynchronously, thus mimicking a MIMO platform to pinpoint the positions of WIFI, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and LoRa devices. TyrLoc makes three key technical contributions. First, TyrLoc modifies the firmware of inexpensive PlutoSDR that controls the antenna switching pattern and tags the signal associated with each antenna. Second, it develops a two-stage fine-grained carrier frequency offset (CFO) calibration algorithm that harnesses the agile antenna switching pattern and is 10\\texttimes{} more accurate than the baseline method. Third, TyrLoc employs an interpolated transform approach to facilitate angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation in the presence of missing antennas. The AoA-based localization experiments in a multipath-rich indoor environment show that TyrLoc with eight antennas achieves the median errors of 63cm for WIFI, 39cm for BLE and 32cm for LoRa, respectively.",

However, the feasibility of mmWave vehicle-to-everything (V2X) connectivity has long been questioned. One major doubt lies in how the highly directional mmWave links can sustain under high mobility. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive reality check of mmWave V2X networks. We deploy an experimental testbed to mimic a typical mmWave V2X scenario, and customize a COTS mmWave radio to enable microscopic investigation of the channel and the link. We further construct a high-fidelity 3D ray-tracer to reproduce the mmWave characteristics at scale. With this toolset, we study the mmWave V2X coverage, mobility and blockage, codebook/beam management, and spatial multiplexing. Our measurement debunks some common misperceptions of mmWave V2X networks. In particular, due to the constrained roadway network structures, we find the beam management can be handled easily by the often-denounced beam scanning schemes, as long as the codebook is properly designed. Blockage can be almost eliminated through proper basestation deployment and cooperation. Highly effective spatial multiplexing can be realized even without sophisticated MIMO radios. Our work points to possible ways to realize efficient and reliable mmWave networks under high mobility, while maintaining the simplicity of standard network protocols.",

Simultaneously, user preference for lighter phones has resulted in more battery power constrained hand-helds that offload computations to resource intensive cloud. This second trend exacerbates the bandwidth crunch often experienced over wireless networks. Our idea (joint cognitive offloading and scheduling) is to use dynamic spectrum access and management concepts from wireless networking to effect computation offloading and scheduling solutions that achieves near optimal trade-offs between the mobile device and wireless resources. We use all radio available interfaces (e.g. WiFi, LTE) in multi-RAT enabled devices to schedule appropriate components of the application to run either on the mobile device or on the resource-rich cloud, while staying adaptive to the conditions of the wireless network.",

Existing MAC protocols for ad hoc networks fall short of meeting these requirements. In this paper, we present, CoReCast, the first collision embracing protocol for vehicular networks. CoReCast provides high reliability and low delay by leveraging two unique opportunities: no strict constraint on energy consumption, and availability of GPS clocks to achieve near-perfect time and frequency synchronization.Due to low coherence time, the channel changes rapidly in vehicular networks. CoReCast embraces packet collisions and takes advantage of the channel dynamics to decode collided packets. The design of CoReCast is based on a preamble detection scheme that estimates channels from multiple transmitters without any prior information about them. The proposed scheme reduces the space and time requirement exponentially than the existing schemes. The system is evaluated through experiments with USRP N210 and GPS devices placed in vehicles driven on roads in different environments as well as using trace-driven simulations. It provides 15x and 2x lower delay than 802.11p and OCP (Omniscient Clustering Protocol), respectively. Reliability of CoReCast is 8x and 2x better than 802.11p and OCP, respectively.",

                    "abstract": "Smart home Wi-Fi IoT devices are prevalent nowadays and potentially bring significant improvements to daily life. However, they pose an attractive target for adversaries seeking to launch attacks. Since the secure IoT communications are the foundation of secure IoT devices, this study commences by examining the extent to which mainstream security protocols are supported by 40 of the best selling Wi-Fi smart home IoT devices on the Amazon platform. It is shown that 29 of these devices have either no security protocols deployed, or have problematic security protocol implementations. Seemingly, these vulnerabilities can be easily fixed by installing security patches. However, many IoT devices lack the requisite software/hardware resources to do so. To address this problem, the present study proposes a SecWIR (Secure Wi-Fi IoT communication Router) framework designed for implementation on top of the users' existing home Wi-Fi routers to provide IoT devices with a secure IoT communication capability. However, it is way challenging for SecWIR to function effectively on all home Wi-Fi routers since some routers are resource-constrained. Thus, several novel techniques for resolving this implementation issue are additionally proposed. The experimental results show that SecWIR performs well on a variety of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi routers at the expense of only a small reduction in the non-IoT data service throughput (less than 8%), and small increases in the CPU usage (4.5%~7%), RAM usage (1.9 MB~2.2 MB), and the IoT device access delay (24 ms~154 ms) while securing 250 IoT devices.",

However, for real-world MIMO deployments, estimating the downlink wireless channel from each antenna on the base station to every client device is a critical bottleneck, especially for the widely used frequency duplexed designs that cannot utilize reciprocity. Typically, this channel estimation requires explicit feedback from client devices and is prohibitive for large antenna deployments. In this paper, we present FIRE, a system that uses an end-to-end machine learning approach to enable accurate channel estimation without requiring any feedback from client devices. FIRE is interpretable, accurate, and has low compute overhead. We show that FIRE can successfully support MIMO transmissions in a real-world testbed and achieves SNR improvement over 10 dB in MIMO transmissions compared to the current state-of-the-art.",

While visible light communication (VLC) has shown its capability to offer Gigabit-level throughput for applications with high demand for data rate, most are performed indoors and the throughput of outdoor VLC drops to a few Mbps. To fill this performance gap, this paper presents RayTrack, an interference-free outdoor mobile VLC system. The key idea of RayTrack is to use a small but real-time adjustable FOV according to the transmitter location, which can effectively repel interference from the environment and from other transmitters and boost the system throughput. The idea also realizes virtual point-to-point links, and eliminates the need of link access control. To be able to minimize the transmitter detection time to only 20 ms, RayTrack leverages a high-compression-ratio compressive sensing scheme, incorporating a dual-photodiode architecture, optimized measurement matrix and Gaussian-based basis to increase sparsity. Real-world driving experiments show that RayTrack is able to achieve a data rate of 607.9 kbps with over 90% detection accuracy and lower than 15% bit error rate at 35 m, with 70 - 100 km/hr driving speed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first working outdoor VLC system which can offer such range, throughput and error performance while accommodating freeway mobility.",

The design of TouchAuth is based on the electrostatics of iBEP generation and a resulting property, i.e., the iBEPs at two close locations on the same human body are similar, whereas those from different human bodies are distinct. Extensive experiments verify the above property and show that TouchAuth achieves high-profile receiver operating characteristics in implementing the touch-to-access policy. Our experiments also show that a range of possible interfering sources including appliances' electromagnetic emanations and noise injections into the power network do not affect the performance of TouchAuth. A key advantage of TouchAuth is that the iBEP sensing requires a simple analog-to-digital converter only, which is widely available on microcontrollers. Compared with existing approaches including intra-body communication and physiological sensing, TouchAuth is a low-cost, lightweight, and convenient approach for authorized users to access the smart objects found in indoor environments.",

                    "abstract": "Wrist-worn devices hold great potential as a platform for mobile health (mHealth) applications because they comprise a familiar, convenient form factor and can embed sensors in proximity to the human body. Despite this potential, however, they are severely limited in battery life, storage, bandwidth, computing power, and screen size. In this paper, we describe the experience of the research and development team designing, implementing and evaluating Amulet? an open-hardware, open-software wrist-worn computing device? and its experience using Amulet to deploy mHealth apps in the field. In the past five years the team conducted 11 studies in the lab and in the field, involving 204 participants and collecting over 77,780 hours of sensor data. We describe the technical issues the team encountered and the lessons they learned, and conclude with a set of recommendations. We anticipate the experience described herein will be useful for the development of other research-oriented computing platforms. It should also be useful for researchers interested in developing and deploying mHealth applications, whether with the Amulet system or with other wearable platforms.",

In our recent measurement study involving 27 smartwatch users [1], we found that push notifications are used by more than 200 applications, dominated by instant messaging, emails, social media, etc. In this work, we propose a suite of methods to optimize the performance, energy efficiency, and usability of smartwatch push notifications, which have several salient features distinguishing them from regular notifications received on a smartphone: requiring heavy phonewatch cooperation, being delivered over short-range Bluetooth link, and incurring non-trivial energy consumption on watches with very limited battery capacity. Considering these factors, our proposed work focuses on four aspects as elaborated.",

Two application cases for wireless sensing and communication are presented that proves the usefulness of the solution. SWAN is able to provide over 3\\texttimes{} performance improvement on Wi-Fi azimuth estimation and localization and over 30% improvement on Wi-Fi throughput over original Wi-Fi AP with three fixed antennas.",

However, in general, the current app development and usage still remain within the single-device paradigm, falling far short of user expectations. We present FLUID, a new multi-device platform that allows users to migrate or replicate individual user interfaces (UIs) of a single app on multiple devices. In addition, FLUID aims to require no extra development effort to support a wide range of legacy apps that follow the trend of using custom-made UIs. To this end, FLUID analyzes which UI states are necessary to correctly render UI objects, deploys only those states on different devices, and supports cross-device function calls transparently. In this demo, we demonstrate several interesting use cases supported by our Android-based FLUID prototype.",

Recent studies tend to deploy Network Function Virtualization (NFV) services to MEC. Network services in NFV are deployed as Service Function Chains (SFCs). In this paper, we mainly focus on the SFC placement problem in a MEC-NFV environment, which is different from the data center network. Firstly, we formulate this problem as a weighted graph matching problem consisting of graph matching and SFC mapping. Then, we propose a linear programming-based approach to match the edge network and SFC. Finally, we design a Hungarian-based placement algorithm to map SFC in the edge network. A heuristic-based greedy algorithm is also designed to compare the performance. Evaluation results show that our proposed solutions outperform the greedy algorithm in terms of execution time.",

Based on the idea of modulating the light retroreflection with a commercial LCD shutter, we effectively synthesize these off-the-shelf optical components into a sub- mW low power visible light passive transmitter along with a retroreflecting uplink design dedicated for power constrained mobile/IoT devices. On top of that, we design, implement and evaluate PassiveVLC, a novel visible light backscatter communication system. PassiveVLC system enables a battery-free tag device to perform passive communication with the illuminating LEDs over the same light carrier and thus offers several favorable features including battery-free, sniff-proof, and biologically friendly for human-centric use cases. Experimental results from our prototyped system show that PassiveVLC is flexible with tag orientation, robust to ambient lighting conditions, and can achieve up to 1 kbps uplink speed. Link budget analysis and two proof-of-concept applications are developed to demonstrate PassiveVLC's efficacy and practicality.",

In this demo, we demonstrate that another powerful solution for extending physical layer flexibility in OFDM-based technologies is the dynamic adaptation of the channel width. Although some standards already define the possibility of utilizing multiple channel widths (e.g. 20MHz, 10MHz, 5MHz for IEEE 802.11a standards), such an utilization is limited to a static configuration of a value defined during the network set-up. Conversely, we demonstrate that channel width adaptations can be performed in real-time during network operation, even on a per-packet basis. To this purpose, we propose an innovative and efficient receiver design, which allows the transmitter to take decisions about the channel width without explicitly informing the receiver.",

A unique feature of milliMap is that it only leverages a low-cost, off-the-shelf mmWave radar, but can reconstruct a dense grid map with accuracy comparable to lidar, as well as providing semantic annotations of objects on the map. milliMap makes two key technical contributions. First, it autonomously overcomes the sparsity and multi-path noise of mmWave signals by combining cross-modal supervision from a co-located lidar during training and the strong geometric priors of indoor spaces. Second, it takes the spectral response of mmWave reflections as features to robustly identify different types of objects e.g. doors, walls etc. Extensive experiments in different indoor environments show that milliMap can achieve a map reconstruction error less than 0.2m and classify key semantics with an accuracy of ~ 90%, whilst operating through dense smoke.",

The controllers are placed in a distributed manner in a network for reliability and load balancing. However, the placement of controllers considering the whole network is not an efficient approach because applying the objective function to the overall network is a challenging task. Therefore, the division of the network into clusters makes the assignment of the switches to the controller more efficient. The placement of the controller in a cluster not only reduces the latency between the switches and the controller but other objectives such as reliability, load balancing, robustness and energy saving can also be applied to the clusters. Therefore, in this poster, a multi-criteria-decision-making (MCDM) scheme known as the Analytical Network Process (ANP) is proposed for controller place selection using clustering.",

                    "abstract": "DVFS (dynamic voltage and frequency scaling) is a system-level technique that adjusts voltage and frequency levels of CPU/GPU at runtime to balance energy efficiency and high performance. DVFS has been studied for many years, but it is considered still challenging to realize a DVFS that performs ideally for mobile devices for two main reasons: i) an optimal power budget distribution between CPU and GPU in a power-constrained platform can only be defined by the application performance, but conventional DVFS implementations are mostly application-agnostic; ii) mobile platforms experience dynamic thermal environments for many reasons such as mobility and holding methods, but conventional implementations are not adaptive enough to such environmental changes. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based frequency scaling technique, zTT. zTT learns thermal environmental characteristics and jointly scales CPU and GPU frequencies to maximize the application performance in an energy-efficient manner while achieving zero thermal throttling. Our evaluations for zTT implemented on Google Pixel 3a and NVIDIA JETSON TX2 platform with various applications show that zTT can adapt quickly to changing thermal environments, consistently resulting in high application performance with energy efficiency. In a high-temperature environment where a rendering application with the default mobile DVFS fails to keep producing more than a target frame rate, zTT successfully manages to do so even with 23.9% less average power consumption.",

To achieve this long range, we use the transmitter as an RF power source that can be on or off if it does or does not send a packet, respectively, and a receiver that repeatedly measures the noise and interference power level. We use spread spectrum techniques on top of the basic on/off mechanism to overcome the interference caused by other devices' channel access to provide long ranges at a much lower data rate. We implement the protocol on top of commodity WiFi hardware. We discuss our design and how we overcome key challenges such as non-stationary interference, carrier sensing and hardware timing delays. We test ONPC in several situations to show that it achieves significantly longer range than standard WiFi.",

The current way of TCP acknowledgment induces control overhead which is counter-productive for TCP performance especially in wireless local area network (WLAN) scenarios.In this paper, we present a new acknowledgement called TACK (\"Tame ACK\"), as well as its TCP implementation TCP-TACK. TCP-TACK works on top of commodity WLAN, delivering high wireless transport goodput with minimal control overhead in the form of ACKs, without any hardware modification. To minimize ACK frequency, TACK abandons the legacy received-packet-driven ACK. Instead, it balances byte-counting ACK and periodic ACK so as to achieve a controlled ACK frequency. Evaluation results show that TCP-TACK achieves significant advantages over legacy TCP in WLAN scenarios due to less contention between data packets and ACKs. Specifically, TCP-TACK reduces over 90% of ACKs and also obtains an improvement of ~ 28% on good-put. We further find it performs equally well as high-speed TCP variants in wide area network (WAN) scenarios, this is attributed to the advancements of the TACK-based protocol design in loss recovery, round-trip timing, and send rate control.",

                    "abstract": "On-device deep learning (DL) inference has attracted vast interest. Mobile CPUs are the most common hardware for on-device inference and many inference frameworks have been developed for them. Yet, due to the hardware complexity, DL inference on mobile CPUs suffers from two common issues: the poor performance scalability on the asymmetric multiprocessor, and energy inefficiency.We identify the root causes are improper task partitioning and unbalanced task distribution for the poor scalability, and unawareness of model behaviour for energy inefficiency. Based on that, we propose a novel technique called AsyMo for the thread pool implementation of DL frameworks to solve the two issues. The key design principle is to leverage the execution determinism of DL inference, and build an optimal execution plan offline by jointly considering model structures and hardware characteristics. For performance scalability, AsyMo implements cost-model-directed partitioning and asymmetry-aware task scheduling to properly divide and fairly schedule tasks on asymmetric CPUs. For energy saving, AsyMo determines the least-energy cost frequency based on data reuse rate of a model.AsyMo is evaluated on different models and DL frameworks. All gain substantial improvement. For example, AsyMo shows up to 46% performance and 37% energy-efficiency improvement for convolution-dominant models, and up to 97% performance and 1.22\\texttimes{} energy-efficiency improvement for fully-connect-dominant models, compared to an optimized TensorFlow on off-the-shelf mobile CPUs.",

                    "abstract": "Drug effectiveness management is a complicated and challenging task in chronic diseases, like Parkinson's Disease (PD). Drug effectiveness control is not only linked to personal out-of-pocket cost but also affecting the quality of life among patients with chronic symptoms. In the current practice, although that health and medical professionals still play a key role in the personalized treatment plan, the critical decision on drug selection falls upon the individual report when patients call in or visit the clinics. Unfortunately, most of the patients with chronic diseases either fail to report their day-to-day symptoms or have a limited access to medical resources due to economic constraints. In this paper, we present PDLens, a first smartphone-based system to detect drug effectiveness among Parkinson's in daily life. Specifically, PDLens can extract digital behavioral markers related to PD drug responses from everyday activities, including phone calls, standing, and walking. PDLens models the PD symptom severity on drug treatment and detects the change of severity scores before and after drug intake. A ranking-based multi-view deep neural network is developed to decide the drug effectiveness upon the symptom severity changes. To validate the performance of PDLens, we conduct a pilot study with 81 PD patients and monitor their smartphone activities and severity changes over 33693 drug intake events across six (6) months. Compared with the standard clinical drug effectiveness test developed by Motor Disorder Society, results reveal that PDLens is a promising tool to facilitate drug effectiveness detection among PD patients in their daily lives.",

                    "abstract": "Recent research has demonstrated the potential of deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained mobile platforms by trimming down the network complexity using different compression techniques. The current practice only investigate stand-alone compression schemes even though each compression technique may be well suited only for certain types of DNN layers. Also, these compression techniques are optimized merely for the inference accuracy of DNNs, without explicitly considering other application-driven system performance (e.g. latency and energy cost) and the varying resource availabilities across platforms (e.g. storage and processing capability). In this paper, we explore the desirable tradeoff between performance and resource constraints by user-specified needs, from a holistic system-level viewpoint. Specifically, we develop a usage-driven selection framework, referred to as AdaDeep, to automatically select a combination of compression techniques for a given DNN, that will lead to an optimal balance between user-specified performance goals and resource constraints. With an extensive evaluation on five public datasets and across twelve mobile devices, experimental results show that AdaDeep enables up to 9.8x latency reduction, 4.3x energy efficiency improvement, and 38x storage reduction in DNNs while incurring negligible accuracy loss. AdaDeep also uncovers multiple effective combinations of compression techniques unexplored in existing literature.",

To protect sensitive on-screen information, we have developed HideScreen by utilizing the human vision and optical system properties to hide the users' on-screen information from the shoulder surfers.Specifically, HideScreen discretizes the on-screen information (OSI) into grid patterns to neutralize the low-frequency components so that the OSI will \"blend into\" the background when viewed from the outside of the designed range. We have developed and evaluated several ways of hiding both on-screen texts and images from shoulder surfers. Our extensive experimental evaluation of HideScreen has demonstrated its high protection rates (&gt;96% for texts and &gt;99% for images) while providing good user experience.",

                    "abstract": "Addiction is a brain disease manifested by the loss of control over drugs or behaviors, despite negative consequences. Although addiction research has been conducted for decades in psychiatry and neuroscience, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying addiction has not yet been achieved. Recent studies in neuroscience [1] have sought to bring light upon this issue by measuring exploration/exploitation decisions in sequential choice tasks, requiring balancing the need to exploit known options and to explore new ones. These studies show a relationship between addiction and exploration/exploitation decisions. For example, people addicted to substances (e.g. alcohol or methamphetamine) or behaviors (e.g. gambling) have tendencies to explore less, which implies they have difficulties 'seeing the big picture\".There is a small yet growing literature modeling explore/exploit decisions of addicted people through inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) [4]. In this previous work, the models made by decision history of addicted people have higher learning weights and probability to exploit than those of normal people, which means that addicted people are more sensitive to their most recent activity. However, existing methods to measure exploration/exploitation decisions are lab-based game experiments such as n-armed bandit [3] or clock task [6], which are high cost, time-consuming and not scalable. Therefore, they are not suitable for modeling through IRL, which requires large behavioral trajectories. In this work, we argue for the first time that mobile sensing is a more cost-efficient and scalable alternative to the lab-based game experiments for understanding and modeling the mechanisms of addiction (Figure 1).",

While there exist a number of different RAN emulators, following different paradigms, they are limited in their scalability and flexibility, and moreover there is no one commonly accepted RAN emulator. Motivated by this, we present Nervion, a scalable and flexible RAN emulator for mobile core system evaluation that takes a novel cloud-native approach. Nervion embeds innovations to enable scalability via abstractions and RAN element containerization, and additionally supports an even more scalable control-plane only mode. It also offers ample flexibility in terms of realizing arbitrary RAN emulation scenarios, mapping them to compute clusters, and evaluating diverse core system designs. We develop a prototype implementation of Nervion that supports 4G and 5G standard compliant RAN emulation and integrate it into the Powder platform to benefit the research community. Our experimental evaluations validate its correctness and demonstrate its scalability relative to representative set of existing RAN emulators. We also present multiple case studies using Nervion that highlight its flexibility to support diverse types of mobile core evaluations.",

                    "abstract": "We propose and demonstrate accurate 3D real-time indoor localization via broadband nonlinear backscatter in passive devices. The proposed method does not need any relative motion between a reader and a tag or the use of reference anchor nodes. In the conventional radio frequency identification (RFID) system, a passive tag responds to a reader by switching its antenna \"on\" and \"off\". The operation of such conventional backscatter is essentially \"linear\", since the reader-to-tag (downlink) and tag-to-reader (uplink) signals overlap on the same carrier frequency. Although linear backscatter is straightforward, the self-jamming problem caused by strong leakage signals from the transmitter to the receiver is notorious and poses many constraints on the received signal quality, operation bandwidth, modulation flexibility and system complexity. To enable high-accuracy real-time 3D indoor localization for passive devices, we show that nonlinear backscatter is more effective than linear backscatter. Nonlinear backscatter exploits nonlinear elements in passive devices to generate second or higher-order harmonics as the uplink response. Separation of downlink and uplink on different carriers allows immediate self-jamming cancellation and direct un-modulated carrier phase decoding, hence resulting in better received signal quality and broad bandwidth of operation, both of which are critical for the localization system. The broad bandwidth allows the design of an efficient phase-based ranging algorithm - heuristic multi-frequency continuous wave (HMFCW) ranging which resolves ambiguous phase cycles with heuristically optimized sparse carrier frequencies. HMFCW ranging can correctly pin down the phase cycle integer with 100% reliability as long as the phase error falls within \u00b190\u00b0 \\texttimes{} BW% (percentage bandwidth). In our present implementation, we achieved a median ranging error below 1 cm under phase error bounds of \u00b150\u00b0. We realized real-time 3D localization from differential ranging by nonlinear conjugate gradient (CG) search for hyperboloids intersection in a multi-static transceiving system with 1 Tx antenna and 4 Rx antennas. The measured 3D localization median error was 3.5 cm in the indoor environment. Presently, the measurement latency was less than 0.155 seconds. We will present system design, algorithms and a prototype with experimental evaluation.",

In this paper, we enhance the performance of this process in the wireless network domain. We propose STAteful inter-Packet signaL procEssing (STAPLE), a framework of stateful signal processing residing between the physical and link layers. STAPLE transforms the signal processing procedure into a lightweight stateful process that caches in a small-sized memory table physical and link layer header fields as packet state information. The similarity of such information among packets serves as prior knowledge to further enhance the reliability of signal processing and thus improve the wireless network performance. We implement STAPLE on USRP X300-series devices with adapted configurations for 802.11a/b/g/n/ac and 802.15.4. The STAPLE prototype is of low processing complexity and does not change any wireless standard specification. Comprehensive experimental results show that the benefit from STAPLE is universal in various wireless networks.",

                    "abstract": "Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are the industrial control systems and operational infrastructure that can monitor and control the electricity grid. Electricity grids are increasingly transforming from the one-directional way of generating, transmitting, and distributing electricity to smart grids that are multi-directional in the way they monitor, automate, and remotely operate the power sector. SCADA systems are increasingly under cyber attacks illustrating growing vulnerabilities to the smart grids. The U.S. power industry notes the importance of SCADA chain cyber risks and the need to take proactive measures (timely patching of vulnerabilities) to mitigate the risks. However, not all vulnerabilities are always exploited by attackers; and not all vulnerabilities can be patched in resource-constrained scenarios. Therefore, the patch sequence needs to be strategic and efficient.In this poster, we address the critical need to prioritize patching the smart grid SCADA systems on time. This is even more prominent with the advent of new technologies, usage of backup systems, updated standards, and new regulations on the safety and security of the smart grid. In this direction, we present SmartPatch - a patch prioritization method to address patch sequencing of the SCADA chain in the smart grid systems. It analyzes the possible attacker behavior as well as system criticality using game theory for decision making. It provides a patch prioritization strategy that is cost-constrained and reduces the impact of the possible attacks to a large extent.",

We intend to play 3D audio-annotations in the user's ears as she moves and looks at AAR objects in the environment. While companies like Bose and Microsoft are beginning to release such capabilities, they are intended for outdoor environments. Our system aims to explore the challenges indoors, without requiring any infrastructure deployment. Our core idea is two-fold. (1) We jointly use the inertial sensors (IMUs) in earphones and smartphones to estimate a user's indoor location and gazing orientation. (2) We play 3D sounds in the earphones and exploit the human's responses to (re)calibrate errors in location and orientation. We believe this fusion of IMU and acoustics is novel, and could be an important step towards indoor AAR. Our system, Ear-AR, is tested on 7 volunteers invited to an AAR exhibition - like a museum - that we set up in our building's lobby and lab. Across 60 different test sessions, the volunteers browsed different subsets of 24 annotated objects as they walked around. Results show that Ear-AR plays the correct audio-annotations with good accuracy. The user-feedback is encouraging and points to further areas of research and applications.",

QR codes are also gaining importance in the retail sector as a convenient mobile payment method. However, researchers have concerns regarding the security of QR codes, which leave users susceptible to financial loss or private information leakage. In this study, we addressed this issue by developing a novel QR code (called mQRCode), which exploits patterns presenting a specific spatial frequency as a form of camouflage. When the targeted receiver holds a camera in a designated position (e.g., directly in front at a distance of 30 cm from the camouflaged QR code), the original QR code is revealed in form of a Moire pattern. From any other position, only the camouflaged QR code can be seen. In experiments, the decryption rate of mQRCode was &gt; 98.6% within 10.2 frames via a multi-frame decryption method. The decryption rate for cameras positioned 20\u00b0 off axis or &gt; 10cm away from the designated location dropped to 0%, indicating that mQRCode is robust against attacks.",

The widely-used slot-filling approach for building bots of this type requires significant hand-coding, which hinders scalability. Recently, neural network models have been shown to be capable of generating natural \"chitchat\" conversations, but it is unclear whether they will ever work for task modeling. Kite is a practical system for bootstrapping task-oriented bots, leveraging both approaches above. Kite's key insight is that while bots encapsulate the logic of user tasks into conversational forms, existing apps encapsulate the logic of user tasks into graphical user interfaces. A developer demonstrates a task using a relevant app, and from the collected interaction traces Kite automatically derives a task model, a graph of actions and associated inputs representing possible task execution paths. A task model represents the logical backbone of a bot, on which Kite layers a question-answer interface generated using a hybrid rule-based and neural network approach. Using Kite, developers can automatically generate bot templates for many different tasks. In our evaluation, it extracted accurate task models from 25 popular Android apps spanning 15 tasks. Appropriate questions and high-quality answers were also generated. Our developer study suggests that developers, even without any bot developing experience, can successfully generate bot templates using Kite.",

This limits the multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) performance and, hence, the throughput of such systems, especially in dense environments. We present a unique solution based on hybrid digital-analog (HDA) beamforming to overcome the limitation of COTS WiFi hardware and effectively increase the MU-MIMO gain and to unlock the potential of MU-MIMO in WiFi. We use COTS WiFi hardware in combination with a self-developed beamforming module and novel algorithms for the HDA approach, leveraging the MU-MIMO precoding of the WiFi system. The implemented control and signal processing software is fully transparent to the WiFi part, i.e., no protocol changes are needed. We demonstrate the increase in MU-MIMO gain using unmodified COTS end-user terminals.",

Traditional malware-based attacks can quickly spread across these devices, but they are well-understood threats with effective defense techniques such as malware fingerprinting and community-based fingerprint sharing. Recently, fileless attacks---attacks that do not rely on malware files---have been increasing on Linux-based IoT devices, and posing significant threats to the security and privacy of IoT systems. Little has been known in terms of their characteristics and attack vectors, which hinders research and development efforts to defend against them. In this paper, we present our endeavor in understanding fileless attacks on Linux-based IoT devices in the wild. Over a span of twelve months, we deploy 4 hardware IoT honeypots and 108 specially designed software IoT honeypots, and successfully attract a wide variety of real-world IoT attacks. We present our measurement study on these attacks, with a focus on fileless attacks, including the prevalence, exploits, environments, and impacts. Our study further leads to multi-fold insights towards actionable defense strategies that can be adopted by IoT vendors and end users.",

                    "abstract": "In this paper, we perform a systematic design study of the \"elephant in the room\" facing the VR industry -- is it feasible to enable high-quality VR apps on untethered mobile devices such as smartphones? Our quantitative, performance-driven design study makes two contributions. First, we show that the QoE achievable for high-quality VR applications on today's mobile hardware and wireless networks via local rendering or offloading is about 10X away from the acceptable QoE, yet waiting for future mobile hardware or next-generation wireless networks (e.g. 5G) is unlikely to help, because of power limitation and the higher CPU utilization needed for processing packets under higher data rate. Second, we present Furion, a VR framework that enables high-quality, immersive mobile VR on today's mobile devices and wireless networks. Furion exploits a key insight about the VR workload that foreground interactions and background environment have contrasting predictability and rendering workload, and employs a split renderer architecture running on both the phone and the server. Supplemented with video compression, use of panoramic frames, and parallel decoding on multiple cores on the phone, we demonstrate Furion can support high-quality VR apps on today's smartphones over WiFi, with under 14ms latency and 60 FPS (the phone display refresh rate).",

Poaching is a particular threat to high value, large-bodied species, such as elephants, that are slow to reproduce. Increasingly, GPS tracking collars serve as a key tool for studying the behavior and monitoring wildlife globally, including application to anti-poaching efforts. However, collars provide indirect information on poaching, such as immobility, that is often not available in real time. In parallel to collar development, acoustic gunshot detection systems have proliferated in the military and law enforcement. Static systems in wildlife areas have been deployed for detecting poaching, but such systems do not scale geographically. This paper explores the idea of fusing GPS tracking collars with acoustic shockwave detectors to create an animal-borne anti-poaching sensor. A real-time alert of gunshots near elephant groups would enable rangers to respond immediately to such events. The two main technical challenges to such a system are battery life and detection accuracy. The paper presents a prototype designed for elephants that has great promise in addressing these significant technical challenges.",

It supports modular design and element-based programming, similar to the Click router framework [23]. It uses an accelerator-rich architecture, where an embedded processor executes control flows and handles various MAC events. User-defined accelerators offload those tasks, which are either computation-intensive or communication-heavy, or require fine-grained timing control, from the processor, and accelerate them in hardware. Tick applies a number of hardware and software co-design techniques to ensure low latency, including multi-clock-domain pipelining, field-based processing pipeline, separation of data and control flows, etc. We have implemented Tick and validated its effectiveness through extensive evaluations as well as two prototypes of 802.11ac SISO/MIMO and 802.11a/g full-duplex.",

                    "abstract": "Client devices must cooperate to share limited resources in wireless local area networks (WLANs). Standards exist for access points (APs), to use a more holistic view of the RF environment, to share information with clients (802.11v/k), allowing clients to make better performance-impacting decisions, e.g. choosing to roam between APs. Standards intended to lower the cost of these expensive control-plane operations (802.11r) also exist. In this paper, we use large scale measurements to show the limited adoption of existing client-based techniques. We propose ClientMarshal for enterprise WLANs, which provides network infrastructure more control over these decisions without modification to client device software. ClientMarshal divides the enterprise network into logical groups called cells, each consisting of a small number of neighboring APs operating on different channels. All APs belonging to the same cell broadcast the same wireless identity (BSSID) to client devices, and appear as a single virtual AP. The key enabler behind ClientMarshal is FreeSteer (FST), a novel protocol we develop that allows an AP to dynamically steer an associated client to another AP in the same cell based on various network measurements in order to improve overall network performance. This design also improves the roaming experience by bypassing traditional control-plane operations, avoiding significant overhead as well as client implementation defects. Using systematic evaluation and implementation on commodity APs, we show the efficacy and control of FST protocol in client steering. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, FST can steer clients almost 2.5X faster, with 52% higher success rate, and reduce packet loss by more than 68%.",

Compared to existing approaches, our system does not require any users' interactions (e.g., performing specific gestures) and is applicable to practical scenarios where the user's daily activities cause motion artifacts (MA). Notably, we design a robust MA removal method to mitigate the impact of MA. Furthermore, we explore the uniqueness of the human cardiac system and extract the fiducial features in the PPG measurements to train the gradient boosting tree (GBT) classifier, which can effectively differentiate users continuously using low training effort. In particular, we build the prototype of our system using a commodity smartwatch and a WebSocket server running on a laptop for CA. In order to demonstrate the practical use of our system, we will demo our prototype under different scenarios (i.e., static and moving) to show it can effectively detect MA caused by daily activities and achieve a high authentication success rate.",

This has attracted rapid research in the development of chemical sensors which can non-invasively measure analytes available in raw biofluids such as sweat, tears and urine.

                    "abstract": "Infrastructure-assisted autonomous driving is an emerging paradigm that aims to make affordable autonomous vehicles a reality. A key technology for realizing this vision is real-time point cloud registration which allows a vehicle to fuse the 3D point clouds generated by its own LiDAR and those on roadside infrastructures such as smart lampposts, which can deliver increased sensing range, more robust object detection, and centimeter-level navigation. Unfortunately, the existing methods for point cloud registration assume two clouds to share a similar perspective and large overlap, which result in significant delay and inaccuracy in real-world infrastructure-assisted driving settings. This paper proposes VI-Eye - the first system that can align vehicle-infrastructure point clouds at centimeter accuracy in real-time. Our key idea is to exploit traffic domain knowledge by detecting a set of key semantic objects including road, lane lines, curbs, and traffic signs. Based on the inherent regular geometries of such semantic objects, VI-Eye extracts a small number of saliency points and leverage them to achieve real-time registration of two point clouds. By allowing vehicles and infrastructures to extract the semantic information in parallel, VI-Eye leads to a highly scalable architecture for infrastructure-assisted autonomous driving. To evaluate the performance of VI-Eye, we collect two new multiview LiDAR point cloud datasets on an indoor autonomous driving testbed and a campus smart lamppost testbed, respectively. They contain total 915 point cloud pairs and cover three roads of 1.12km. Experiment results show that VI-Eye achieves centimeter-level accuracy within around 0.2s, and delivers a 5X improvement in accuracy and 2X speedup over state-of-the-art baselines.",

                    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become ubiquitous techniques in mobile and embedded systems for applications such as image/object recognition and classification. The trend of executing multiple DNNs simultaneously exacerbate the existing limitations of meeting stringent latency/accuracy requirements on resource constrained mobile devices. The prior art sheds light on exploring the accuracy-resource tradeoff by scaling the model sizes in accordance to resource dynamics. However, such model scaling approaches face to imminent challenges: (i) large space exploration of model sizes, and (ii) prohibitively long training time for different model combinations. In this paper, we present LegoDNN, a lightweight, block-grained scaling solution for running multi-DNN workloads in mobile vision systems. LegoDNN guarantees short model training times by only extracting and training a small number of common blocks (e.g. 5 in VGG and 8 in ResNet) in a DNN. At run-time, LegoDNN optimally combines the descendant models of these blocks to maximize accuracy under specific resources and latency constraints, while reducing switching overhead via smart block-level scaling of the DNN. We implement LegoDNN in TensorFlow Lite and extensively evaluate it against state-of-the-art techniques (FLOP scaling, knowledge distillation and model compression) using a set of 12 popular DNN models. Evaluation results show that LegoDNN provides 1,296x to 279,936x more options in model sizes without increasing training time, thus achieving as much as 31.74% improvement in inference accuracy and 71.07% reduction in scaling energy consumptions.",

                    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, Vehicular Ad hoc Networks have attracted the attention of numerous researchers from both academia and industry. Today, this promising wireless communication technology plays an indispensable role as vehicles exchange low-latent safety critical messages with one another in a bid to make the road traffic more safer, efficient, and convenient. However, dissemination of malicious messages within the network not only significantly reduces the network performance but also becomes a source of threat for the passengers and vulnerable pedestrians. Accordingly, a number of trust models have been recently proposed in the literature to ensure the identification and elimination of malicious vehicles from the network. These trust models primarily rely on the aggregation of both direct and indirect observations and evict the malicious vehicles based on a particular threshold set on this composite trust value. Nevertheless, setting-up of this threshold poses a significant challenge especially owing to diverse influential factors in such a dynamic and distributed networking environment. To this end, in this manuscript, machine learning has been employed to compute the aggregate trust score for flagging and evicting of the malicious vehicles from a vehicular network. It is evident from the simulated results that the devised method is both accurate and scalable.",

With the availability of high-quality cameras and computational power on smartphones, it is possible and helpful to identify unknown prescription pills using smartphones. Towards this goal, in 2016, the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced a nationwide competition, calling for the creation of a mobile vision system that can recognize pills automatically from a mobile phone picture under unconstrained real-world settings. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of such mobile pill image recognition system called MobileDeepPill. The development of MobileDeepPill involves three key innovations: a triplet loss function which attains invariances to real-world noisiness that deteriorates the quality of pill images taken by mobile phones; a multi-CNNs model that collectively captures the shape, color and imprints characteristics of the pills; and a Knowledge Distillation-based deep model compression framework that significantly reduces the size of the multi-CNNs model without deteriorating its recognition performance. Our deep learning-based pill image recognition algorithm wins the First Prize (champion) of the NIH NLM Pill Image Recognition Challenge. Given its promising performance, we believe MobileDeepPill helps NIH tackle a critical problem with significant societal impact and will benefit millions of healthcare personnel and the general public.",

For instance, the Samsung Knox security platform implements a kernel integrity monitor based on a hardware-assisted virtualization technique for 64-bit devices. Although it protects the OS kernel integrity, the monitoring platform itself can be a target of attackers if it encompasses exploitable bugs. In this paper, we propose SelMon, a portable way of self-protecting kernel integrity monitors without introducing another higher privileged trust anchor. To this end, we first logically separate the regions of the integrity monitor into two parts: privileged and non-privileged regions. Then, we ensure that only the privileged region code can access the critical data objects that can be exploited to compromise the monitor integrity (e.g., the hypervisor page table). The non-critical operations in terms of preserving the monitor integrity are conducted in the non-privileged region. In addition to the privilege separation, we also illustrate how to utilize the general hardware features, watchpoint and data execution prevention (DEP), to ensure the robustness of the separation. In the evaluation, it was found that our approach imposes a negligible overhead of 2% in the worst case with SPEC CPU2006.",

These new experiences come with privacy concerns as they can send sensitive on-screen data (bank details, medical data, etc.) to the cloud. We propose a novel approach that efficiently extracts app content semantics on the device, without exfiltrating user data. Our solution consists of two phases: an offline, user-agnostic, in-cloud phase that automatically annotates apps' UI elements with stable semantics, and a lightweight on-device phase that assigns semantics to captured app contents on the fly, by matching the annotations. With this automatic approach we annotated 100+ food, dining, and music apps, with accuracy over 80%. Our system implementation for Android and Windows Phone---Appstract---incurs minimal runtime overhead. We built eight use cases on the Appstract framework.",

This paper develops high-preCision Acoustic Tracker (CAT), which aims to replace a traditional mouse and let a user control various devices by moving a smartphone in the air. At its heart lies a distributed Frequency Modulated Continuous Waveform (FMCW) that can accurately estimate the distance between a transmitter and a receiver that are separate and unsynchronized. We further develop an optimization framework to combine FMCW estimation with Doppler shifts to enhance the accuracy. We implement CAT on a mobile phone. The performance evaluation and user study show that our system achieves high tracking accuracy and ease of use using existing hardware.",

Solving this task with single-channel, audio-only methods remains an open challenge, especially for practical scenarios involving a mixture of competing speakers and background noise. In this paper, we propose UltraSE, which uses ultrasound sensing as a complementary modality to separate the desired speaker's voice from interferences and noise. UltraSE uses a commodity mobile device (e.g., smartphone) to emit ultrasound and capture the reflections from the speaker's articulatory gestures. It introduces a multi-modal, multi-domain deep learning framework to fuse the ultrasonic Doppler features and the audible speech spectrogram. Furthermore, it employs an adversarially trained discriminator, based on a cross-modal similarity measurement network, to learn the correlation between the two heterogeneous feature modalities. Our experiments verify that UltraSE simultaneously improves speech intelligibility and quality, and outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by a large margin.",

However, existing RDMA technologies are ill-suited to multi-tenant datacenters, where applications run at massive scales, tenants require isolation and security, and the workload mix changes over time. Our experiences seeking to operationalize RDMA at scale indicate that these ills are rooted in standard RDMA's basic design attributes: connectionorientedness and complex policies baked into hardware.We describe a new approach to remote memory access -- One-Shot RMA (1RMA) -- suited to the constraints imposed by our multi-tenant datacenter settings. The 1RMA NIC is connection-free and fixed-function; it treats each RMA operation independently, assisting software by offering fine-grained delay measurements and fast failure notifications. 1RMA software provides operation pacing, congestion control, failure recovery, and inter-operation ordering, when needed. The NIC, deployed in our production datacenters, supports encryption at line rate (100Gbps and 100M ops/sec) with minimal performance/availability disruption for encryption key rotation.",

However, existing sensing devices do not seem to offer a full capability in mapping the in-wall structure while identifying their status (e.g., seepage and corrosion). In this paper, we design and implement SiWa as a low-cost and portable system for wall inspections. Built upon a customized IR-UWB radar, SiWa scans a wall as a user swipes its probe along the wall surface; it then analyzes the reflected signals to synthesize an image and also to identify the material status. Although conventional schemes exist to handle these problems individually, they require troublesome calibrations that largely prevent them from practical adoptions. To this end, we equip SiWa with a deep learning pipeline to parse the rich sensory data. With innovative construction and training, the deep learning modules perform structural imaging and the subsequent analysis on material status, without the need for repetitive parameter tuning and calibrations. We build SiWa as a prototype and evaluate its performance via extensive experiments and field studies; results evidently confirm that SiWa accurately maps in-wall structures, identifies their materials, and detects possible defects, suggesting a promising solution for diagnosing building health with minimal effort and cost.",

However, it is very challenging to enable this capability on such devices due to tightly constrained image contents (only eye-area images available from the on-device eye-tracking camera) and computing resources of the embedded system. In this paper, we propose and develop a novel system called EMO that can recognize, on top of a resource-limited eyewear device, real-time emotions of the user who wears it. Unlike most existing solutions that require whole-face images to recognize emotions, EMO only utilizes the single-eye-area images captured by the eye-tracking camera of the eyewear. To achieve this, we design a customized deep-learning network to effectively extract emotional features from input single-eye images and a personalized feature classifier to accurately identify a user's emotions. EMO also exploits the temporal locality and feature similarity among consecutive video frames of the eye-tracking camera to further reduce the recognition latency and system resource usage. We implement EMO on two hardware platforms and conduct comprehensive experimental evaluations. Our results demonstrate that EMO can continuously recognize seven-type emotions at 12.8 frames per second with a mean accuracy of 72.2%, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art approach, and consume much fewer system resources.",

The proposed system benefits existing IoT systems by enabling intuitive interaction between a user and IoT devices and further enhancing visualization of the data collected from IoT sensors. VisIoT achieves them through a combination of wireless sensing and camera motion tracking. By using the azimuth and elevation angles between the wireless transmitter and the camera-equipped mobile device, VisIoT can instantly identify the location of the IoT device from the camera image. This paper introduces novel azimuth and elevation estimation algorithms that leverage the phase difference of the signals from two antennas together with the tracked camera rotation. We prototype VisIoT using a tablet PC and a USRP software radio, and develop a software that tracks and visualizes the location of ZigBee nodes in real time. The evaluation results show that VisIoT can accurately track the nodes with the median position error of 6%.",

The duty cycled LTE-U is shown to be fair with Wi-Fi technology by following an ON-OFF cycle for its transmission. However, the effect of LTE-U on the video quality of Wi-Fi users has not been studied in the literature. In this work, we study the video quality performance of a Wi-Fi user in the presence of LTE-U, in a testbed system. Our results show that the parameters that contribute to the video QoE (Quality of Experience) of Wi-Fi users get adversely affected as the fraction of channel utilized by LTE-U increases, but the same is not shown to be true with another Wi-Fi. We found that poor video QoE of Wi-Fi users in the presence of LTE-U is because of a large number of packet collisions and less channel access time due to ON cycle of LTE-U.",

Gaussian pulse shaping is a missing piece in state-of-the-art BLE backscatter systems. Inspired by active BLE and applying calculus, we present IBLE, a BLE backscatter communication system that achieves full compatibility with commodity BLE devices. IBLE leverages the fact that phase shift is the integral of frequency over time to build a reliable physical layer for BLE backscatter. IBLE uses instantaneous phase shift (IPS) modulation, GFSK modulation, and optional FEC coding to improve the reliability of BLE backscatter communication to the commodity level. We prototype IBLE using various commodity BLE devices and a customized tag with FPGA. Empirical results demonstrate that IBLE achieves PERs of 0.04% and 0.68% when the uplink distances are 2 m and 14 m respectively, which are 280x and 70x lower than the PERs of the state-of-the-art system RBLE. On the premise of meeting the BER requirements of the BLE specification, the uplink range of IBLE is 20 m. Since BLE devices are everywhere, IBLE is readily deployable in our everyday IoT applications.",

We first characterize the power consumption patterns of a state of the art AR headset, Magic Leap One, and empirically show that its internal GPU is the most impactful and controllable energy consumer. Based on the preliminary studies, we design LpGL so that it uses the device's gaze/head orientation information and geometry data to infer user perception information, intercepts application-level graphics API calls, and employs frame rate control, mesh simplification, and culling techniques to enhance energy efficiency of AR headsets without detriment of user experience. Results from a comprehen- sive set of controlled in-lab experiments and an IRB-approved user study with 25 participants show that LpGL reduces up to 22% of total energy usage while adding only 46 sec of latency per object with close to no loss in subjective user experience.",

However, existing soil moisture sensors are too expensive to deploy in every pot. We therefore introduce GreenTag, a low-cost RFID-based soil moisture sensing system whose accuracy is comparable to that of an expensive soil moisture sensor. Our key idea is to attach two RFID tags to a plant's container so that changes in soil moisture content are reflected in their Differential Minimum Response Threshold (DMRT) metric at the reader. We show that a low-pass filtered DMRT metric is robust to changes both in the RF environment (e.g., from human movement) and in pot locations. In a realistic setting, GreenTag achieves a 90-percentile moisture estimation errors of 5%, which is comparable to the 4% errors using expensive soil moisture sensors. Moreover, this accuracy is maintained despite changes in the RF environment and container locations. We also show the effectiveness of GreenTag in a real greenhouse.",

                    "abstract": "Portable devices, like smartphones and tablets, are often subject to runtime configuration changes, such as screen orientation changes, screen resizing, keyboard attachments, and language switching. When handled improperly, such simple changes can cause serious runtime issues, from data loss to app crashes.This work presents, to our best knowledge, the first formative study on runtime change handling with 3,567 Android apps. The study not only reveals the current landscape of runtime change handling, but also points out a common cause of various runtime change issues -- activity restarting. On one hand, the restarting facilitates the resource reloading for the new configuration. On the other hand, it may slow down the app, and more critically, it requires developers to manually preserve a set of data in order to recover the user interaction state after restarting.Based on the findings of this study, this work further introduces a re starting-free runtime change handling solution -- RuntimeDroid. RuntimeDroid can completely avoid the activity restarting, at the same time, ensure proper resource updating with user input data preserved. These are achieved with two key components: an online resource loading module, called HotR and a novel UI components migration technique. The former enables proper resources loading while the activity is still live. The latter ensures that prior user changes are carefully preserved during runtime changes.For practical use, this work proposes two implementations of RuntimeDroid: an IDE plugin and an auto-patching tool. The former allows developers to easily adopt restarting-free runtime change handling during the app developing; The latter can patch released app packages without source code. Finally, evaluation with a set of 72 apps shows that RuntimeDroid successfully fixed all the 197 reported runtime change issues, meanwhile reducing the runtime change handling delays by 9.5X on average.",

Specifically, BreathPrint uses the audio signatures associated with the three individual gestures: sniff, normal, and deep breathing, which are sufficiently different across individuals. Using these three breathing gestures, we develop the processing pipeline that identifies users via the microphone sensor on smartphones and wearable devices. In BreathPrint, a user performs breathing gestures while holding the device very close to their nose. Using off-the-shelf hardware, we experimentally evaluate the BreathPrint prototype with 10 users, observed over seven days. We show that users can be authenticated reliably with an accuracy of over 94% for all the three breathing gestures in intra-sessions and deep breathing gesture provides the best overall balance between true positives (successful authentication) and false positives (resiliency to directed impersonation and replay attacks). Moreover, we show that this breathing sound based biometric is also robust to some typical changes in both physiological and environmental context, and that it can be applied on multiple smartphone platforms. Early results suggest that breathing based biometrics show promise as either to be used as a secondary authentication modality in a multimodal biometric authentication system or as a user disambiguation technique for some daily lifestyle scenarios.",

However, from a clinical researcher point of view, testing novel use of the mobile health innovations remains a major hurdle, as composing a clinical trial using a combination of technologies still remains in the realm of computer scientists. We take a software-inspired viewpoint of clinical trial designs to design, develop and validate HealthSense to enable expressibility of complex ideas, composability with diverse devices and services while maximally maintaining simplicity for a clinical research user. A key innovation in HealthSense is the concept of a study state manager (SSM) that modifies parameters of the study over time as data accumulates and can trigger external events that affect the participant; this design allows us to implement nearly arbitrary clinical trial designs. The SSM can funnel data streams to custom or third-party cloud processing pipelines and the result can be used to give interventions and modify parameters of the study. HealthSense supports both Android and iOS platforms and is secure, scalable and fully operational. We outline three trials (two with clinical populations) to highlight simplicity, composability, and expressibility of HealthSense.",

                    "abstract": "Cognitive state monitoring is crucial for neurological disorders such as epilepsy, narcolepsy, insomnia, and many other human health concerns. The capability to continuously monitor an individual wearing the device and accurately provide early warnings of seizures or narcolepsy sleep attacks would be game-changing for these disorders. Beyond human health, complete hand-free/voice-free human-computer interaction is desirable for privacy-sensitive use cases or people with disabilities. To achieve this goal, we propose Earable, an ear-worn biosensing platform for cognitive state quantification and human-computer interaction. Earable can capture biosignal including brain waves activities, eyes movements, and facial muscle contractions from the back of the ears. Its form factor is convenient to use in everyday life. In this demo, we show two use cases for our Earable platform. First, as an example of cognitive state monitoring, our system plays relaxing music and dims the light when the user is trying to relax or sleep by detecting alpha and beta waves generated by the brain. Second, as an example of human-computer interaction, our system controls a drone with eye movements and facial muscle activity.",

Each visually detected participant is tagged with a smartphone ID and the target person with the query ID is highlighted. This work is motivated by the fact that establishing associations between subjects observed in camera images and messages transmitted from their wireless devices can enable fast and reliable tagging. This is particularly helpful when target pedestrians need to be found on public surveillance footage, without the reliance on facial recognition. The underlying system uses a multi-modal approach that leverages WiFi Fine Timing Measurements (FTM) and inertial sensor (IMU) data to associate each visually detected individual with a corresponding smartphone identifier. These smartphone measurements are combined strategically with RGB-D information from the camera, to learn affinity matrices using a multi-modal deep learning network.",

Yet the radar functionality is limited to identifying the positions of reflectors in the environment. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of smartening transportation infrastructure for the purpose of conveying richer information to automotive radars. We propose RoS, a passive PCB-fabricated smart surface which can be reconfigured to embed digital bits, and inform the radar much like visual road signs do to cameras. We design the RoS signage to act as a retrodirective reflector which can reflect signals back to the radar from wide viewing angles. We further introduce a spatial encoding scheme, which piggybacks information in the reflected analog signals based on the geometrical layout of the retroreflective elements. Our prototype fabrication and experimentation verifies the effectiveness of RoS as an RF ''barcode'' which is readable by radar in practical transportation environment.",

In this work, we make the case for a ceilingmounted mobile (CMM) AP by comparing its performance with other types of AP mobility and single static AP. We then present Hawkeye to solve the optimal location discovery problem for a CMM AP using a machine learning (ML) algorithm. Hawkeye relies purely on the connectivity matrix between STAs and the AP to decide if and where the AP should move to for maximizing LOS connectivity. Using a prototype implementation, we show that the throughput of Hawkeye is 219% and 129% compared with single static AP and other approaches for AP mobility, respectively.",

Existing device free human activity recognition approaches and systems, though yielding reasonably good performance in certain cases, are faced with a major challenge. The wireless signals arriving at the receiving devices usually carry substantial information that is specific to the environment where the activities are recorded and the human subject who conducts the activities. Due to this reason, an activity recognition model that is trained on a specific subject in a specific environment typically does not work well when being applied to predict another subject's activities that are recorded in a different environment. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose EI, a deep-learning based device free activity recognition framework that can remove the environment and subject specific information contained in the activity data and extract environment/subject-independent features shared by the data collected on different subjects under different environments. We conduct extensive experiments on four different device free activity recognition testbeds: WiFi, ultrasound, 60 GHz mmWave, and visible light. The experimental results demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed EI framework.",

SolarGest is based on the observation that each gesture interferes with incident light rays on the solar panel in a unique way, leaving its distinguishable signature in harvested photocurrent. Using solar energy harvesting laws, we develop a model to optimize design and usage of SolarGest. To further improve the robustness of SolarGest under non-deterministic operating conditions, we combine dynamic time warping with Z-score transformation in a signal processing pipeline to pre-process each gesture waveform before it is analyzed for classification. We evaluate SolarGest with both conventional opaque solar cells as well as emerging see-through transparent cells. Our experiments with 6,960 gesture samples for 6 different gestures reveal that even with transparent cells, SolarGest can detect 96% of the gestures while consuming 44% less power compared to light sensor based systems.",

Future wireless networks will support 100 Gbps communication between people, devices, and the \"Internet of Things,\" with high reliability and uniform coverage indoors and out. The shortage of spectrum to support such systems will be alleviated by advances in massive MIMO and mmW technology as well as cognitive radios. Wireless technology will also enable smart and energy-efficient homes and buildings, automated highways and skyways, and in-body networks for monitoring, analysis and treatment of medical conditions. Breakthrough energy-efficiency architectures, algorithms and hardware will allow wireless networks to be powered by tiny batteries, energy-harvesting, or over-the-air power transfer. Finally, new communication systems based on biology and chemistry to encode bits will enable a wide range of new micro and macroscale applications. There are many technical challenges that must be overcome in order to make this vision a reality. This talk will describe what the wireless future might look like along with some of the innovations and breakthroughs required to realize this vision.",

MegaSense involves a novel hierarchy of multi-vendor distributed air quality sensors, in which accurate sensors calibrate lower cost sensors. Current low-cost air quality sensors suffer from measurement drift and they have low accuracy. We address this significant open problem for dense urban areas by developing a calibration scheme that detects and automatically corrects drift. MegaSense integrates with the 5G cellular network and leverages mobile edge computing for sensor management and distributed pollution map creation. We demonstrate MegaSense with two sensor types, a state of the art air quality monitoring station and a low-cost sensor array, with calibration between the two to improve the accuracy of the low-cost device. Participants can interact with the sensors and see air quality changes in real-time, and observe the mechanism to mitigate sensor drift. Our re-calibration method minimizes the error for NO2 and O3 81% of the time (vs single calibration) and reduces the mean relative error by 25%-45%.",

Yet, getting this large amount of data back to Earth is challenging because of their low orbits and fast motion through space. Centralized architectures with few multi-million dollar ground stations incur large hour-level data download latency and are hard to scale. We propose a geographically distributed ground station design, L2D2, that uses low-cost commodity hardware to offer low latency robust downlink. L2D2 is the first system to use a hybrid ground station model, where only a subset of ground stations are uplink-capable. We design new algorithms for scheduling and rate adaptation that enable low latency and high robustness despite the limitations of the receive-only ground stations. We evaluate L2D2 through a combination of trace-driven simulations and real-world satellite-ground station measurements. Our results demonstrate that L2D2's geographically distributed design can reduce data downlink latency from 90 minutes to 21 minutes.",

To ease this goal, Android provides an API, called the SafetyNet Attestation API, that can be used to detect if the device an app is running in is in a \"safe\" state (e.g., non-rooted) and if the app's code has not been modified (using, for instance, app repackaging). In this paper, we perform the first large-scale systematic analysis of the usage of the SafetyNet API. Our study identifies many common mistakes that app developers make when attempting to use this API. Specifically, we provide a systematic categorization of the possible misusages of this API, and we analyze how frequent each misuse is. Our results show that, for instance, more than half of the analyzed apps check SafetyNet results locally (as opposed to using a remote trusted server), rendering their checks trivially bypassable. Even more surprisingly, we found that none of the analyzed apps invoking the SafetyNet API uses it in a fully correct way.",

On the bicycle side, a microcontroller, a rotation sensor, and a Bluetooth module are used to calculate the cycling speed of the biker, sense the rotation period of wheels, and communicate with the biker's smartphone, respectively. On the biker side, a smartphone is used to detect the riding direction (through the built-in gyroscope), receive the cycling speed data (through Bluetooth communications), and determine the feasible frame updating rate of street view/virtual reality (through the proposed fuzzy control mechanism). Based on the current and historical cycling speeds, All-You-Can-Bike can derive the feasible frame updating rate based on the defined fuzzy sets of wheel rotation periods and cycling acceleration. An Android-based prototype with the Arduino developing board is implemented to verify the feasibility and superiority of our All-You-Can-Bike system.",

It will enable researchers to explore the technology \"sweet spot\" of ultra-high bandwidth and ultra-low latency in the most demanding real-world environment. We describe the testbed's architecture, the design and deployment challenges, and the experience gained during the design and pilot deployment. Specifically, we describe COSMOS' computing and network architectures, the critical building blocks, and its programmability at different layers. The building blocks include software-defined radios, 28 GHz millimeter-wave phased array modules, optical transport network, core and edge cloud, and control and management software. We describe COSMOS' deployment phases in a dense urban environment, the research areas that could be studied in the testbed, and specific example experiments. Finally, we discuss our experience with using COSMOS as an educational tool.",

Even more, there is a strong need for objective data about stability and performance of MBB (e.g., 3G/4G) networks, and for tools that rigorously and scientifically assess their status. In this paper, we introduce the MONROE measurement platform: an open access and flexible hardware-based platform for measurements and custom experimentation on operational MBB networks. The MONROE platform enables accurate, realistic and meaningful assessment of the performance and reliability of 11 MBB networks in Europe. We report on our experience designing, implementing and testing the solution we propose for the platform. We detail the challenges we overcame while building and testing the MONROE testbed and argue our design and implementation choices accordingly. We describe and exemplify the capabilities of the platform and the wide variety of experiments that external users already perform using the system.",

However, current live streaming solutions are known to suffer from frequent uplink throughput fluctuations causing unnecessary video stalls and quality drops. As a remedy to this problem, we propose PERCEIVE, a deep learning-based uplink throughput prediction framework. PERCEIVE exploits a 2-stage LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) design and makes throughput predictions for the next 100ms. Our extensive evaluations show that PERCEIVE, trained with LTE network traces from three major operators in the U.S., achieves high accuracy in the uplink throughput prediction with only 7.67% mean absolute error and outperforms existing prediction techniques. We integrate PERCEIVE with WebRTC, a popular video streaming platform from Google, as a rate adaptation module. Our implementation on the Android phone demonstrates that it can improve PSNR by up to 6dB (4x) over the default WebRTC while providing less streaming latency.",

                    "abstract": "Headphones continue to become more intelligent as new functions (e.g., touch-based gesture control) appear. These functions usually rely on auxiliary sensors (e.g., accelerometer and gyroscope) that are available in smart headphones. However, for those headphones that do not have such sensors, supporting these functions becomes a daunting task. This paper presents HeadFi, a new design paradigm for bringing intelligence to headphones. Instead of adding auxiliary sensors into headphones, HeadFi turns the pair of drivers that are readily available inside all headphones into a versatile sensor to enable new applications spanning across mobile health, user-interface, and context-awareness. HeadFi works as a plug-in peripheral connecting the headphones and the pairing device (e.g., a smartphone). The simplicity (can be as simple as only two resistors) and small form factor of this design lend itself to be embedded into the pairing device as an integrated circuit. We envision HeadFi can serve as a vital supplementary solution to existing smart headphone design by directly transforming large amounts of existing \"dumb\" headphones into intelligent ones. We prototype HeadFi on PCB and conduct extensive experiments with 53 volunteers using 54 pairs of non-smart headphones under the institutional review board (IRB) protocols. The results show that HeadFi can achieve 97.2%--99.5% accuracy on user identification, 96.8%--99.2% accuracy on heart rate monitoring, and 97.7%--99.3% accuracy on gesture recognition.",

                    "abstract": "Recognition of human-object interactions is practically important in various human-centric sensing scenarios such as smart supermarket, factory, and home. This paper proposes an RF-Camera system by fusing RFID and Computer Vision (CV) techniques, which is the first work to recognize the human gestural interactions with physical objects in multi-subject and multi-object scenarios. In RF-Camera, we first propose a dimension reduction method to transform the subject's 3D hand trajectory captured by depth camera to a 2D image, using which the subject's gesture can be recognized. We also propose a method to extract the facial image of target subject from an image that may contain irrelevant subjects, thereby further recognizing his/her identity. Finally, we model the physical movements of the held object's tag and further predict the tag phase data, by comparing which with real phase data of each tag human-object matching can be discovered. When implementing RF-Camera, three technical challenges need to be addressed. (i) To remove noisy data corresponding to irrelevant actions from raw sensing data, we propose a state transition diagram to determine the boundary of effective data. (ii) To predict phase data of the held target tag with unknown hand-tag offset, we quantify target tag trajectory by adding a variable hand-tag vector to captured hand trajectory. (iii) To ensure high reading rates of target tags in tag-dense scenarios, we propose a CV-assisted RFID scheduling method, in which analytics on CV data can help schedule RFID readings. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of RF-Camera. Experimental results demonstrate that RF-Camera can recognize the gestural actions, human identity and human-object matching with an average accuracy higher than 90% in most cases.",

                    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) provides an effective way to create an Aerial Panoramic Map (APM). Generally, it consists of three steps: 1) select a set of locations from a map, 2) take photos from different angles at each selected location one by one, and 3) make panoramic images by the Panoramic Mosaic technology, and then create an APM with these images. However, it is always labor-intensive and time-consuming to complete these steps in a large region such as a campus and a park, due to multiple reasons: 1) inexperience for location selection, 2) low-efficiency for manually operating UAV to fly among different locations one by one and make photos from different angles, and 3) limited energy supply and low-efficiency for a single UAV. DJI GO[1] has been developed to simplify a part of operations in steps 2) and 3), by which we only need one button to take photos automatically from different angles at a selected location. However, it is still required to manually select locations and control UAV to fly among different locations. Moreover, the defects of using a single UAV still exist. By contrast, we aim to design an Auto nomously C ooperative U AV system platform for P anoramic map generation, AutoCUP, which leverages multiple UAVs to full-automatically and high-efficiently complete all steps of creating an APM.",

Realtime multi-track audio streaming with precise synchronization however poses significant challenges to the existing wireless microphone array designs that depend on complex digital synchronization as well as bulky and power-hungry hardware.This paper presents a novel microphone array sensor architecture that enables synchronous concurrent transmission of multitrack audio signals using analog backscatter communication. We develop novel Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) and Differential Pulse Position Modulation (DPPM) baseband circuits that can generate a spectral-efficient, time-multiplexing, and multi-track-synchronous baseband signal for backscattering. Its lightweight analog synchronization supports parallel multimedia signals without using any ADCs, DSPs, codecs and RF transceivers, hence largely reducing the complexity, latency, and power consumption. To further enhance self-sustainability, we also design an energy harvester that can extract energy from both sound and RF. We have built a microphone array backscatter sensor prototype using an FPGA, discrete components, and analog devices. Our experiments demonstrate a communication range (sensor-to-reader) of up to 28 meters for 8 audio tracks, and an equivalent throughput of up to 6.4 Mbps with a sample rate over 48KHz. Our sensor achieves 87.4\u03bcs of streaming latency for 4 tracks, which is 650x improvement as compared with digital solutions. ASIC design results show that it consumes as low as 175.2\u03bcW of power. Three sample applications including an acoustic imaging system, a beamform filter, and a voice control system, all built with our phased-array microphone, further demonstrate the applicability of our design.",

Different from the existing password-based approaches, the proposed system builds upon a touch sensing technique using vibration signals that can operate on any solid surface. In this poster, we explore the feasibility of using vibration signals for ubiquitous user authentication and develop algorithms that identify fine-grained finger inputs with different password secrets (e.g., PIN sequences). We build a prototype using a vibration transceiver that can be attached to any surface (e.g., a door or a desk) easily. Our experiments in office environments with multiple users demonstrate that we can achieve high authentication accuracy with a low false negative rate.",

This empowers operators of large airports and retail facilities to optimize cost-intensive resource allocation as well as to provide location-based services to their customers such as geo-fencing and proximity marketing. However, existing PIPS often generate noisy location estimates due to unpredictable interference and attenuation of wireless signals in indoor environments. To address this problem, we propose a novel map matching approach that uses a floor map to constrain location estimates to possible paths a mobile user can take.",

In this paper we discuss both the challenges and the opportunities that make this an auspicious time to revisit how we might best structure the Internet's infrastructure. Currently, the tasks of transit-between-domains and last-mile-delivery are jointly handled by a set of ISPs who interconnect through BGP. In this paper we propose cleanly separating these two tasks. For transit, we propose the creation of a \"public option\" for the Internet's core backbone. This public option core, which complements rather than replaces the backbones used by large-scale ISPs, would (i) run an open market for backbone bandwidth so it could leverage links offered by third-parties, and (ii) structure its terms-of-service to enforce network neutrality so as to encourage competition and reduce the advantage of large incumbents.",

However, we are yet to enjoy such improvement in real-world environments, as they lack rich scattering and preclude effective MIMO spatial multiplexing. In this paper, we present ScatterMIMO, which uses smart surface to increase the scattering in the environment, to provide MIMO spatial multiplexing gain. Specifically, smart surface pairs up with a wireless transmitter device say an active AP and re-radiates the same amount of power as any active access point (AP), thereby creating virtual passive APs. ScatterMIMO avoids the synchronization, interference, and power requirements of conventional distributed MIMO systems by leveraging virtual passive APs, allowing its smart surface to provide spatial multiplexing gain, which can be deployed at a very low cost. We show that with optimal placement, these virtual APs can provide signals to their clients with power comparable to real active APs, and can increase the coverage of an AP. Furthermore, we design algorithms to optimize ScatterMIMO's smart surface for each client with minimal measurement overhead and to overcome random per-packet phase offsets during the measurement. Our evaluations show that with commercial off-the-shelf MIMO WiFi (11ac) AP and unmodified clients, ScatterMIMO provides a median throughput improvement of 2 X over the active AP alone.",

Examples of this encounter-based communication (EbC) include social exchange among individuals who shared an experience, and interaction among personal and IoT devices that provide location-based services. Existing EbC systems are limited to communication among participants that share a direct encounter. This paper is inspired by two insights: (1) encounters also enable group communication among devices connected by paths in the encounter graph that is contextual, spontaneous, secure, and does not require users to reveal identifying or linkable information; and (2) addressing communication partners using encounter closures subject to causal, spatial, and temporal constraints enables powerful new forms of group communication. We present the design of enClosure, a service providing group communication based on encounter closures for mobile and IoT applications, and a prototype implementation for Android and the Microsoft Embedded Social Cloud platform. Using real-world traces, we show that enClosure provides a privacy-preserving, secure platform for a wide range of group communication applications ranging from connecting attendees of a large event and virtual guest books to disseminating health risk warnings, lost-and-found, and tracing missing persons.",

However, there is a sense of urgency now in understanding and preventing concussions better, due to raising public awareness. Towards that end, intra-oral devices such as Vector MouthGuards are being studied [3] to measure the athlete's head's linear and rotational accelerations from impacts experienced in practices and games. But given the players' natural distaste for such intra-oral devices, more palatable alternatives for head impact monitoring are being developed [2]. X2 Biosystems xPatchis an electronic skin patch thatis worn behind the ear. Reebok Checklight embeds the impact sensor in the back of a skullcap which can be worn with or without a helmet. Triax SIM-P is placed inside a headband for non-helmeted sports and a skullcap for helmeted sports. While all these devices are much more convenient to wear than intra-oral devices, it is yet to be seen whether they gain wider acceptance, particularly by the millions of amateur soccer players all over the world.",

In this paper, we propose a novel interference cancellation technique -- Concurrent Interference Cancellation (CIC), that enables concurrent decoding of multiple collided LoRa packets. CIC fundamentally differs from existing approaches as it demodulates symbols by canceling out all other interfering symbols. It achieves this cancellation by carefully selecting a set of sub-symbols -- pieces of the original symbol such that no interfering symbol is common across all sub-symbols in this set. Thus, after demodulating each sub-symbol, an intersection across their spectra cancels out all the interfering symbols. Through LoRa deployments using COTS devices, we demonstrate that CIC can increase the network capacity of standard LoRa by up to 10x and up to 4x over the state-of-the-art research. While beneficial across all scenarios, CIC has even more significant benefits under low SNR conditions that are common to LoRa deployments, in which prior approaches appear to perform quite poorly.",

For example, a smartwatch can assist its paired smartphone with downloading data. Inspired by the success of MPTCP, MPBond applies the concept of distributed multipath transport where multiple subflows can traverse different devices. We develop a cross-device connection management scheme, a buffering strategy, a packet scheduling algorithm, and a policy framework tailored to MPBond's architecture. We implement MPBond on commodity mobile devices such as Android smartphones and smartwatches. Our real-world evaluations using different workloads under various network conditions demonstrate the efficiency of MPBond. Compared to state-of-the-art collaboration frameworks, MPBond reduces file download time by 5% to 46%, and improves the video streaming bitrate by 2% to 118%. Meanwhile, it improves the energy efficiency by 10% to 57%.",

We examine different 5G carriers, deployment schemes (Non-Standalone, NSA vs. Standalone, SA), radio bands (mmWave and sub 6-GHz), protocol configurations (_e.g._ Radio Resource Control state transitions), mobility patterns (stationary, walking, driving), client devices (_i.e._ User Equipment), and upper-layer applications (file download, video streaming, and web browsing). Our findings reveal key characteristics of commercial 5G in terms of throughput, latency, handover behaviors, radio state transitions, and radio power consumption under the above diverse scenarios, with detailed comparisons to 4G/LTE networks. Furthermore, our study provides key insights into how upper-layer applications should best utilize 5G by balancing the critical tradeoff between performance and energy consumption, as well as by taking into account the availability of both network and computation resources. We have released the datasets and tools of our study at https://github.com/SIGCOMM21-5G/artifact.",

It is a common practice to conduct DNN model-based inference using cloud services due to their high computation and memory cost. However, such a cloud-offloaded inference raises serious privacy concerns. Malicious external attackers or untrustworthy internal administrators of clouds may leak highly sensitive and private data such as image, voice and textual data. In this paper, we propose Occlumency, a novel cloud-driven solution designed to protect user privacy without compromising the benefit of using powerful cloud resources. Occlumency leverages secure SGX enclave to preserve the confidentiality and the integrity of user data throughout the entire DL inference process. DL inference in SGX enclave, however, impose a severe performance degradation due to limited physical memory space and inefficient page swapping. We designed a suite of novel techniques to accelerate DL inference inside the enclave with a limited memory size and implemented Occlumency based on Caffe. Our experiment with various DNN models shows that Occlumency improves inference speed by 3.6x compared to the baseline DL inference in SGX and achieves a secure DL inference within 72% of latency overhead compared to inference in the native environment.",

It was believed that if an attacker can replay the exact same reply signal of a legitimate authentication object (such as an RFID tag), any physical-layer authentication method will fail. This paper presents Hu-Fu, the first physical layer RFID authentication protocol that is resilient to the major attacks including tag counterfeiting, signal replay, signal compensation, and brute-force feature reply. Hu-Fu is built on two fundamental ideas, namely inductive coupling of two tags and signal randomization. Hu-Fu does not require any hardware or protocol modification on COTS passive tags and can be implemented with COTS devices. We implement a prototype of Hu-Fu and demonstrate that it is accurate and robust to device diversity and environmental changes, including locations, distance, and temperature. Hu-Fu provides a new direction of battery-free/low-power device authentication that enables numerous IoT applications.",

In particular, meChat understands the semantics of on-going conversation and in-device photos by projecting both of them into a single semantic space. Subsequently, it retrieves in-device photos related to the conversation context. Through this process, meChat makes it easy for the users to share the photos while communicating in messaging applications. In addition, it is worth noting that meChat works in a stand-alone, privacy-protecting manner without sending out any in-device photos and conversations to the external servers. This is different from existing photo services (e.g., Google Photos) which resort on the cloud server.",

One of the major problems is that a legal drone may be illegally hijacked by GPS spoofing attacks. Though some GPS anti-spoofing techniques have been proposed, no effective technique has been implemented in commodity drones yet due to practical limitations. Motivated by the ubiquitous WiFi signals around us, we propose WiDrone, a WiFi fingerprint location cross-check based anti-hijacking system on commodity drones in this poster. WiDrone still relies on GPS for navigation but it will authenticate the destination by comparing current WiFi fingerprint (CWF) with the destination WiFi fingerprint (DWF) when the drone receives a landing order. Furthermore, we propose a WiFi fingerprint authentication algorithm to decide whether CWF matches DWF. We have designed and implemented the prototype of WiDrone on DJI Matrice 100 to ascertain the practicability of proposed system.",

However, it is difficult to coherently coordinate distributed agents by means of limited local information. In this demo, we propose a decentralized collaboration method named as \"stigmergy\" in network-assisted MAS, by exploiting digital pheromones (DP) as an indirect medium of communication and utilizing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) on top. Correspondingly, we implement an experimental platform, where KHEPERA IV robots form targeted specific shapes in a decentralized manner. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Our platform could be conveniently extended to investigate the impact of network factors (e.g., latency, data rate, etc).",

In a span of 20 years, the speed of these networks has increased from 1 Mbps to more than 1 Gbps. Today's Wi-Fi networks may consist of a variety of client devices, ranging from slow legacy 802.11a/b/g to modern and fast 802.11n/ac devices. We describe preliminary findings from a large-scale study obtained from 448 Google Wifi and Google OnHub access points with 2,975 clients. We focus on characterizing the maximum achievable bitrate of heterogeneous wireless links. We also determine the average physical-layer bitrate used on the down link (AP to client) and compare it with the maximum supported bitrate. We find that about 75% of 802.11n and 50% of 802.11ac client devices operate at 75% of their maximum or more and that the bitrates of the remaining devices can be very far from their maximum. These low bitrates could significantly reduce the throughput of high-bitrate devices.",

Alongside, the failure rate of satellites has also surged increased tremendously. Satellites are non-repairable systems in orbit, and the financial loss incurred when the satellites fail before their expected mission time is substantial. If the source of a failure is known while the satellite is in orbit, then there is a possibility to revive it by sending appropriate commands from ground stations. In this work, we present a simple, independent satellite health monitoring system called Chirper. The Chirper is equipped with multiple modules such as IMU, isolated voltage and current measurement probes, and an onboard communication channel. We present a new approach to measure low DC voltages in an isolated way, providing a resolution and accuracy of around 1 V. We evaluated the design and performance of the Chirper through simulation, testing it in space systems test facility, and by mounting it on a helium balloon.

                    "abstract": "As smartphones and tablets have become ubiquitous, there is a growing demand for apps that can enable users to collaboratively use multiple mobile systems. We present Tap, a framework that makes it easy for users to dynamically compose collections of mobile systems and developers to write apps that make use of those impromptu collections. Tap users control the composition by simply tapping systems together for discovery and authentication. The physical interaction mimics and supports ephemeral user interactions without the need for tediously exchanging user contact information such as phone numbers or email addresses. Tapping triggers a simple NFC-based mechanism to exchange connectivity information and security credentials that works across heterogeneous networks and requires no user accounts or cloud infrastructure support. Tap makes it possible for apps to use existing mobile platform APIs across multiple mobile systems by virtualizing data sources so that local and remote data sources can be combined together upon tapping. Virtualized data sources can be hardware or software features, including media, clipboard, calendar events, and devices such as cameras and microphones. Leveraging existing mobile platform APIs makes it easy for developers to write apps that use hardware and software features across dynamically composed collections of mobile systems. We have implemented a Tap prototype that allows apps to make use of both unmodified Android and iOS systems. We have modified and implemented various apps using Tap to demonstrate that it is easy to use and can enable apps to provide powerful new functionality by leveraging multiple mobile systems. Our results show that Tap has good performance, even for high-bandwidth features, and is user and developer friendly.",

                    "abstract": "Arterial blood pressure (ABP) monitoring using wearables has emerged as a promising approach to empower users with self-monitoring for effective diagnosis and control of hypertension. However, existing schemes mainly monitor ABP at discrete time intervals, involve some form of user effort, have insufficient accuracy, and require collecting sufficient training data for model development. To tackle these problems, we propose Crisp-BP, a novel ABP monitoring system leveraging the PPG sensor available in commercial wrist-worn devices (e.g., smartwatches or fitness trackers). It enables continuous, accurate, user-independent ABP monitoring and requires no behavior changes during collecting PPG data. The basic idea is to illuminate a skin/tissue, measure the light absorption, and characterize ABP-related blood volume change in the artery. To obtain accurate measurements and relieve the pain of training data collection, we use an arterial pulse extraction method that removes interference caused by capillary pulses. Moreover, we design a contact pressure estimation method to combat the deficiency of PPG waveform being sensitive to the contact pressure between the sensor and the skin. In addition, we leverage the great power of Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory and design a hybrid neural network model to enable user-independent ABP monitoring, so that users do not have to provide training data for model development. Furthermore, we propose a transfer learning method that first extracts general knowledge from online PPG data, then use it to improve the learning of a new model on our target problem. Extensive experiments with 35 participants demonstrate that Crisp-BP obtains the average estimation error of 0.86 mmHg and 1.67 mmHg and the standard deviation error of 6.55 mmHg and 7.31 mmHg for diastolic pressure and systolic pressure, respectively. These errors are within the acceptable range regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows average errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg. Our results demonstrate that Crisp-BP is promising for improving the diagnosis and control of hypertension as it provides continuousness, comfort, convenience, and accuracy.",

This leads to common manual memory management problems like buffer overflow and use-after-free. Higher-level languages, which have managed runtimes, allow for automated memory management, the benefits of which are widely accepted. To allow for automated memory management of TAs, we need to have a runtime that handles allocation and garbage collection (GC). However, having the entire allocator and GC in the secure world would increase the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) of the secure world. We propose TrustGC, a mechanism to partition garbage collection and allocation between the secure world and the normal world. TrustGC allows for automated memory management of TAs by leveraging the help of a GC partly running in the normal world.",

Unfortunately, prior approaches to on-demand DIFT are a poor match for modern mobile platforms that rely heavily on parallelism to provide good interactivity in the face of computationally intensive tasks like image processing. The main shortcoming of these prior efforts is that they cannot support an arbitrary mix of parallel threads due to the limitations of page protections.In this paper, we identify parallel permissions as a key requirement for multithreaded, on-demand native DIFT, and we describe the design and implementation of a system called SandTrap that embodies this approach. Using our prototype implementation, we demonstrate that SandTrap's native DIFT overhead is proportional to the amount of tainted data that native code processes. For example, in the photo-sharing app Instagram, SandTrap's performance is close to baseline (1x) when the app does not access tainted data. When it does, SandTrap imposes a slowdown comparable to prior DIFT systems (~8x).",

An adversary may launch a drone impersonation attack, where the adversary's drone purports to be a legitimate delivery drone. To protect against such attacks, authenticating drones is crucial. Existing authentication schemes based on digital certificates have been shown to be compromised by security breaches on certificate authorities. Thus, we propose SoundUAV as a second factor of authentication for drones that leverages uniqueness in acoustic emanations to fingerprint drones, even within the same make and model. This uniqueness is attributed to hardware defects in motors, making SoundUAV secure against impersonation and robust to large scale attacks. Further, SoundUAV requires no hardware modifications to drones as it utilizes the pervasive acoustic emanations. We perform preliminary evaluation on eleven drones and obtain a fingerprinting accuracy of 99.48%.",

In these cases, close physical proximity among devices that have never shared a secret key is sometimes used as a basis of trust; devices in close proximity are deemed trustworthy while more distant devices are viewed as potential adversaries. Because radio waves are invisible, however, a user may believe a wireless device is communicating with a nearby device when in fact the user's device is communicating with a distant adversary. Researchers have previously proposed methods for multi-antenna devices to ascertain physical proximity with other devices, but devices with a single antenna, such as those commonly used in the Internet of Things, cannot take advantage of these techniques.We present theoretical and practical evaluation of a method called SNAP -- SiNgle Antenna Proximity -- that allows a single-antenna Wi-Fi device to quickly determine proximity with another Wi-Fi device. Our proximity detection technique leverages the repeating nature Wi-Fi's preamble and the behavior of a signal in a transmitting antenna's near-field region to detect proximity with high probability; SNAP never falsely declares proximity at ranges longer than 14 cm.",

State-of-the-art solutions for vehicle sensing may not build accurate and complete knowledge of all vehicle trajectories. In order to fill the gap, this paper proposes VeTrac, a comprehensive system that employs widely deployed traffic cameras as a sensing network to trace vehicle movements and reconstruct their trajectories in a large scale. VeTrac fuses mobility correlation and vision-based analysis to reduce uncertainties in identifying vehicles. A graph convolution process is employed to maintain the identity consistency across different camera observations, and a self-training process is invoked when aligning with the urban road network to reconstruct vehicle trajectories with confidence. Extensive experiments with real-world data input of over 7 million vehicle snapshots from over one thousand traffic cameras demonstrate that VeTrac achieves 98% accuracy for simple expressway scenario and 89% accuracy for complex urban environment. The achieved accuracy outperforms alternative solutions by 32% for expressway scenario and by 59% for complex urban environment.",

In this paper, we describe two fundamental challenges to efficient RDR proxying: the increasing popularity of encrypted HTTPS content, and the fact that, due to time-dependent network conditions and page properties, RDR proxying can actually increase load times. We solve these problems by introducing a new, secure proxying scheme for HTTPS traffic, and by implementing WatchTower, a selective proxying system that uses dynamic models of network conditions and page structures to only enable RDR when it is predicted to help. WatchTower loads pages 21.2%-41.3% faster than state-of-the-art proxies and server push systems, while preserving end-to-end HTTPS security.",

To truly enable VR everywhere, we need position tracking to be available as a ubiquitous service. This paper demonstrates WiCapture, a novel approach which leverages commodity WiFi infrastructure, which is ubiquitous today, for tracking purposes. We prototyped WiCapture using off-the-shelf WiFi radios and demonstrated that it achieves an accuracy of 0.88 cm compared to sophisticated infrared-based tracking systems like the Oculus Rift, while providing much higher range, resistance to occlusion, ubiquity and ease of deployment.",

Due to the bandwidth limitations of LoRaWAN, existing localization methods without specialized hardware (e.g., GPS) produce poor performance. To increase the localization accuracy, we propose a super-resolution localization method, called Seirios, which features a novel algorithm to synchronize multiple non-overlapped communication channels by exploiting the unique features of the radio physical layer to increase the overall bandwidth. By exploiting both the original and the conjugate of the physical layer, Seirios can resolve the direct path from multiple reflectors in both indoor and outdoor environments. We design a Seirios prototype and evaluate its performance in an outdoor area of 100 m \\texttimes{} 60 m, and an indoor area of 25 m \\texttimes{} 15 m, which shows that Seirios can achieve a median error of 4.4 m outdoors (80% samples &lt; 6.4 m), and 2.4 m indoors (80% samples &lt; 6.1 m), respectively. The results show that Seirios produces 42% less localization error than the baseline approach. Our evaluation also shows that, different to previous studies in Wi-Fi localization systems that have wider bandwidth, time-of-fight (ToF) estimation is less effective for LoRaWAN localization systems with narrowband radio signals.",

The IoT environment sensor can analyze the IAQ(Indoor Air Quality), occupancy, and comfort level of the individual space by integrating temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, sound, illuminance, organic compound, human body detection and IR sensor in the individual space of the building. In addition, because it supports Wifi mesh network, it can be easily installed without performing construction for retrofit in existing building, and real time monitoring can be performed.

Existing collective communication libraries focus on optimizing operations for dense inputs, resulting in transmissions of many zeros when inputs are sparse. This counters current trends that see increasing data sparsity in large models.We propose OmniReduce, an efficient streaming aggregation system that exploits sparsity to maximize effective bandwidth use by sending only non-zero data blocks. We demonstrate that this idea is beneficial and accelerates distributed training by up to 8.2x. Even at 100 Gbps, OmniReduce delivers 1.4--2.9x better performance for network-bottlenecked DNNs.",

The BeePlanner component performs chunk scheduling, while the BeeBuzzer component manages and coordinates the chunk exchange among devices.",

This problem is likely to expand given the rapid proliferation of drones for commerce, monitoring, recreation, and other applications. A cost-effective detection system is needed to warn of the presence of drones in such cases. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of inexpensive RF-based detection of the presence of drones. We examine whether physical characteristics of the drone, such as body vibration and body shifting, can be detected in the wireless signal transmitted by drones during communication. We consider whether the received drone signals are uniquely differentiated from other mobile wireless phenomena such as cars equipped with Wi- Fi or humans carrying a mobile phone. The sensitivity of detection at distances of hundreds of meters as well as the accuracy of the overall detection system are evaluated using software defined radio (SDR) implementation.",

We present the ambiguity problem of the Doppler monitoring system. We find that RSS from a wireless network is complimentary to Doppler signal, and we propose to integrate Doppler with RSS to make respiration monitoring more robust. Our experimental results show that the respiration rate estimation is more accurate by sensor fusion of these two radio frequency (RF) sensing modalities.",

                    "abstract": "Voice assistants raise serious security and privacy concerns because they use always-on microphones in sensitive locations (e.g., inside a home) and send audio recordings to the cloud for processing. The cloud transcribes these recordings and interprets them as user requests, and sometimes even shares these requests with third-party services. These steps may result in unintended or malicious voice data leaks and in unauthorized actions, such as a purchase. This paper presents MegaMind, a novel extensible platform that lets a user deploy security and privacy extensions locally on their voice assistant. MegaMind's extensions interpose on requests before sending them to the cloud and on responses before delivering them to the user. MegaMind's programming model enables writing powerful extensions with ease, such as one for secure conversations. Additionally, MegaMind protects against malicious extensions by providing two important guarantees, namely permission enforcement and non-interference. We implement MegaMind and integrate it with Amazon Alexa Service SDK. Our evaluation shows that MegaMind achieves a small conversation latency on platforms with adequate compute power, such as a Raspberry Pi 4 and an x86-based laptop.",

However, to create visual harmony between virtual and physical spaces, the virtual scene must be accurately illuminated with realistic lighting that matches the physical environment. To this end, we design GLEAM, a framework that provides robust illumination estimation in real-time by integrating physical light-probe estimation with current mobile AR systems. We present a demo implementation of GLEAM by means of an AR application that estimates environmental illumination and renders the scene with real-time illumination updates. We demonstrate the efficacy of GLEAM's estimation against a current commercial status quo solution, Apple's ARKit, with the same application.",

This requires suitable experimentation platforms to support systems-oriented research to tackle the multitude of problems and challenges of mm-wave communications in such environments. To this end, we introduce mm-FLEX, a flexible and modular open platform with real-time signal processing capabilities that supports a bandwidth of 2 GHz and is compatible with mm-wave standard requirements. mm-FLEX integrates an FPGA-based baseband processor with full-duplex capabilities together with mm-wave RF front-ends and phased antenna arrays that are fully configurable from the processor in real-time. To demonstrate the capabilities of mm-FLEX, we implement a scalable, ultra-fast beam alignment mechanism for IEEE 802.11ad systems. It is based on compressive estimation of the signal's angle-of-arrival by means of switching through multiple receive beam patterns on a nano-second time-scale while receiving a packet preamble. Our implementation is open source and is made publicly available to the research community.",

So, fast charging has been the focus of both industry and academia, developing and deploying various technologies, such as Quick Charge by Qualcomm, TurboPower by Motorola, Flash Charge by OPPO, etc. Fast charging, unfortunately, accelerates the capacity fading of device battery because it follows the Constant Current, Constant Voltage (CCCV) charge principle without considering the behavior of how users charge their devices. CCCV charging principle is a two-phase charging process consisting of (i) Constant-Current Charge (CC-Chg) and (ii) Constant-Voltage Charge (CV-Chg) [2] where CV-Chg is usually triggered at the end of charging (e.g., 80-100%) to stabilize the battery condition. However, fast charging technologies are agnostic of users' available charging time, resulting in premature termination of the planned charging if users only have limited time. This, in turn, leads to an incomplete CV-Chg phase or even skipping it completely. From our empirical measurements, we discovered that CV-Chg relaxes the batteries and slows down their capacity fading by up to 80% [1] incomplete CV-Chg shortens the battery life significantly over time!",

While such systems initially used reflected light as the communication media, direct light becomes the dominant media for the purpose of combating interference. Nonetheless, the data rate achievable by direct light LED-Camera VLC systems has hit its bottleneck: the dimension of the transmitters. In order to further improve the performance, we revisit the reflected light approach and we innovate in converting the potentially destructive interferences into collaborative transmissions. Essentially, our ReflexCode system codes information by superposing light emissions from multiple transmitters. It combines traditional amplitude demodulation with slope detection to \"decode\" the grayscale modulated signal, and it tunes decoding thresholds dynamically depending on the spatial symbol distribution. In addition, ReflexCode re-engineers the balanced codes to avoid flicker from individual transmitters. We implement ReflexCode as two prototypes and demonstrate that it can achieve a throughput up to 3.2kb/s at a distance of 3m.",

In this paper, we propose SmartSense, a device-free human activity recognition system based on a novel machine learning algorithm with existing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) WiFi routers. By exploiting the prevalence of existing WiFi infrastructure in buildings, we developed a novel OpenWrt based firmware for COTS WiFi routers to collect the CSI measurements from regular data frames. To identify different human activities, an automatic kernel representation learning method, namely auto-HSRL, is established to selection informative Hilbert space patterns from time, frequency, wavelet, and shape domains. A new information fusion tool based on multi-view kernel learning is proposed to combine the representations extracted from diverse perspectives and build up a robust and comprehensive activity classifier. Extensive experiments were conducted in an office and the experimental results demonstrate that SmartSense outperforms existing methods and achieves a 98% activity recognition accuracy.",

In-N-Out can continuously charge a medical implant residing in deep tissues at near-optimal beamforming power, even when the implant moves around inside the human body. To accomplish this, we exploit the unique energy ball pattern of distributed antenna array and devise a backscatter-assisted beamforming algorithm that can concentrate RF energy on a tiny spot surrounding the medical implant. Meanwhile, the power levels on other body parts stay in low level, reducing the risk of overheating. We proto-type In-N-Out on 21 software-defined radios and a printed circuit board (PCB). Extensive experiments demonstrate that In-N-Out achieves 0.37 mW average charging power inside a 10 cm-thick pork belly, which is sufficient to wirelessly power a range of commercial medical devices. Our head-to-head comparison with the state-of-the-art approach shows that In-N-Out achieves 5.4X-18.1X power gain when the implant is stationary, and 5.3X-7.4X power gain when the implant is in motion.",

Automatic emotion recognition is helpful for monitoring psychological disorders, mental problems and exploring behavioral mechanisms. Existing approaches adopt costly and bulky specialized hardware such as EEG/ECG helmet, possess privacy risks, or with low accuracy and user experience. With the increasing popularity of wearables, people tend to equip multiple smart devices, which provides potential opportunity for emotion perception. In this paper, we present a pervasive and portable system called MW-Emotion to recognize common emotional states with multi-modal wearable devices. However, ubiquitous wearable devices perceive shallow information which is not obviously related to human emotions. MW-Emotion excavates intrinsic mapping relationship between emotions and sensing data. Our experiments show that MW-Emotion can recognize different emotion states with a relatively high accuracy of 83.1%.",

                    "abstract": "As datacenter network bandwidth keeps growing, proactive transport becomes attractive, where bandwidth is proactively allocated as \"credits\" to senders who then can send \"scheduled packets\" at a right rate to ensure high link utilization, low latency, and zero packet loss. While promising, a fundamental challenge is that proactive transport requires at least one-RTT for credits to be computed and delivered. In this paper, we show such one-RTT \"pre-credit\" phase could carry a substantial amount of flows at high link-speeds, but none of existing proactive solutions treats it appropriately. We present Aeolus, a solution focusing on \"pre-credit\" packet transmission as a building block for proactive transports. Aeolus contains unconventional design principles such as scheduled-packet-first (SPF) that de-prioritizes the first-RTT packets, instead of prioritizing them as prior work. It further exploits the preserved, deterministic nature of proactive transport as a means to recover lost first-RTT packets efficiently. We have integrated Aeolus into ExpressPass[14], NDP[18] and Homa[29], and shown, through both implementation and simulations, that the Aeolus-enhanced solutions deliver signiicant performance or deployability advantages. For example, it improves the average FCT of ExpressPass by 56%, cuts the tail FCT of Homa by 20x, while achieving similar performance as NDP without switch modifications.",

The data sizes for different modalities can be highly asymmetric (e.g., video vs. audio), and these differences can lead to significant delays between streams in the presence of wireless dynamics. Therefore, a slow stream can significantly slow down a multi-modal inference system in the cloud, leading to either increased latency (when blocked by the slow stream) or degradation in inference accuracy (if inference proceeds without waiting). In this paper, we introduce speculative inference on multi-modal data streams to adapt to these asymmetries across modalities. Rather than blocking inference until all sensor streams have arrived and been temporally aligned, we impute any missing, corrupt, or partially-available sensor data, then generate a speculative inference using the learned models and imputed data. A rollback module looks at the class output of speculative inference and determines whether the class is sufficiently robust to incomplete data to accept the result; if not, we roll back the inference and update the model's output. We implement the system in three multi-modal application scenarios using public datasets. The experimental results show that our system achieves 7 -- 128\\texttimes{} latency speedup with the same accuracy as six state-of-the-art methods.",

In WLAN, using a central controller for resource sharing and management is a common practice in mid-size and large-size network. However, in case of small businesses (i.e., restaurants, coffee shops, etc.), business owners cannot afford to obtain the controller. To realize the bandwidth sharing among Access Points (AP) in a distribute manner, seamless handoff of mobile devices (i.e., smartphones and tablets) between small-business owned Access Points (APs) via association control and maintain stable TCP connection are essential but quite challenging. This poster proposes a novel way to cooperatively share wireless resources among the APs. This includes an efficient association control between stations and APs, dedicated virtual access point per station, and tunneling support maintaining existing TCP connection after relocation to another AP.",

The proposed deep learning framework addresses a series of challenges. First, it encodes a 3D human body model, which enables mmMesh to estimate complex and realistic-looking 3D human meshes from sparse point clouds. Second, it can accurately align the 3D points with their corresponding body segments despite the influence of ambient points as well as the error-prone nature and the multi-path effect of the RF signals. Third, the proposed model can infer missing body parts from the information of the previous frames. Our evaluation results on a commercial mmWave sensing testbed show that our mmMesh system can accurately localize the vertices on the human mesh with an average error of 2.47 cm. The superior experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed human mesh construction system.",

However, 4G/5G mobility management is not always reliable in extreme mobility, with non-negligible failures and policy conflicts. The root cause is that, existing mobility management is primarily based on wireless signal strength. While reasonable in static and low mobility, it is vulnerable to dramatic wireless dynamics from extreme mobility in triggering, decision, and execution. We devise REM, Reliable Extreme Mobility management for 4G, 5G, and beyond. REM shifts to movement-based mobility management in the delay-Doppler domain. Its signaling overlay relaxes feedback via cross-band estimation, simplifies policies with provable conflict freedom, and stabilizes signaling via scheduling-based OTFS modulation. Our evaluation with operational high-speed rail datasets shows that, REM reduces failures comparable to static and low mobility, with low signaling and latency cost.",

Facial paralysis patients usually have muscles on one side of the face noticeably droop, which seriously impacts the person's quality of life as shown in Fig. [skull]. Worse still, the eye on the affected side is unable to blink and will become dry and infected by debries, which can incur eye damage even blindness. To the best of scientists' knowledge, the paralysis is due to the pressure incurred by infection in the tunnel containing main trunk of facial nerves, where the tunnel is inside of the people's head termed as the Facial canal. In this demo, we present iBlink [1], a novel system to help paralysis patients to blink. Paralysis usually occurs in just one side of the face, and clinical trials show that electrical stimulation could trigger blink. Based on such observations, the basic idea of iBlink is to monitor the normal side of the face with a camera and stimulate the paralysed side, so that eye-movements of the both sides become symmetric.",

Prognosis can learn models that vary in abstraction level from simple deterministic automata to models containing data operations, such as register updates, and can be used to unlock a variety of analysis techniques -- model checking temporal properties, computing differences between models of two implementations of the same protocol, or improving testing via model-based test generation. Prognosis is modular and easily adaptable to different protocols (e.g. TCP and QUIC) and their implementations. We use Prognosis to learn models of (parts of) three QUIC implementations -- Quiche (Cloudflare), Google QUIC, and Facebook mvfst -- and use these models to analyse the differences between the various implementations. Our analysis provides insights into different design choices and uncovers potential bugs. Concretely, we have found critical bugs in multiple QUIC implementations, which have been acknowledged by the developers.",

Example applications are augmented reality Head-Up-Display in a connected car [2], scout drone that chases a target suspect among the crowd [3], autonomous fleet drones [1], and so on. These futuristic applications in various genres of devices are latency-sensitive and require a significant computation power to process a tremendous amount of data from built-in sensors [8]. However, the capabilities of processors shipped with these devices are limited. A natural solution is offloading to an edge surrogate,1 running on a 'nearby' edge-cloud that offers more computation capacity at low latency.",

Yet today's UAVs rely critically on inertial sensors and GPS to remain stable in-flight, meaning they struggle to penetrate urban canyons where GPS is unavailable. This poster presents LoRaTilt, a system that maintains stability of a UAV using a Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LP-WAN) transmitter. We mount a light-weight and ten-year battery-powered LP-WAN transmitter on a UAV and process its signals from base stations up to hundreds of meter away. We demonstrate how our system estimates and corrects for UAV drift in GPS-denied settings with minimal impact on the cost and flight life of a UAV. Our proof-of-concept experiments show a promising median accuracy of 1.2326 mm and 0.0164 radians in estimating the displacement and orientation of a drone with a LoRa LP-WAN radio.",

State-of-art approaches with unmodified LCD(s) as optical modulator cause flickering with a sub-kbps low data rate, which would be overcome by modulating polarization, but naive implementation requires careful Tx-Rx placement to avoid signal cancellation. To overcome such challenges, we propose a new modulation scheme called polarization-based quadrature amplitude modulation (PQAM). PQAM constructs the orthogonal basis in the polarization domain and provides 2x throughput gain with arbitrary relative orientation.",

We evaluate these methodologies against DNS resolvers in the Internet and compare them with respect to effectiveness, applicability and stealth. Our study shows that DNS cache poisoning is a practical and pervasive threat.We then demonstrate cross-layer attacks that leverage DNS cache poisoning for attacking popular systems, ranging from security mechanisms, such as RPKI, to applications, such as VoIP. In addition to more traditional adversarial goals, most notably impersonation and Denial of Service, we show for the first time that DNS cache poisoning can even enable adversaries to bypass cryptographic defences: we demonstrate how DNS cache poisoning can facilitate BGP prefix hijacking of networks protected with RPKI even when all the other networks apply route origin validation to filter invalid BGP announcements. Our study shows that DNS plays a much more central role in the Internet security than previously assumed.We recommend mitigations for securing the applications and for preventing cache poisoning.",

However, cellphone tower coverage is not uniform and is affected by electromagnetic shadows cast by large structures, multipath, and absorption by various surfaces. Users with high data needs suffer in such locations due to insufficient network bandwidth. A similar insufficiency can also be felt by flash crowds in locations with otherwise moderate signal strength due to division of the available bandwidth.We explore the possibility of using drones as a solution to this problem. The drones can hover with direct line of sight with a cellphone tower and extend cellular coverage into the weaker regions. Our idea is to use the knowledge of large structures in the area to compute the expected SNR space around the client's current location. We use ray-tracing techniques to compute the expected SNR in an area. We then verify its similarity with ground truth by measuring, at several locations on the ground, the received signal strength from a Wifi router on a drone.",

We propose Sirius, an optically-switched network for datacenters providing the abstraction of a single, high-radix switch that can connect thousands of nodes---racks or servers---in a datacenter while achieving nanosecond-granularity reconfiguration. At its core, Sirius uses a combination of tunable lasers and simple, passive gratings that route light based on its wavelength. Sirius' switching technology and topology is tightly codesigned with its routing and scheduling and with novel congestion-control and time-synchronization mechanisms to achieve a scalable yet flat network that can offer high bandwidth and very low end-to-end latency. Through a small-scale prototype using a custom tunable laser chip that can tune in less than 912 ps, we demonstrate 3.84 ns end-to-end reconfiguration atop 50 Gbps channels. Through large-scale simulations, we show that Sirius can approximate the performance of an ideal, electrically-switched non-blocking network with up to 74-77% lower power.",

However, adopting wireless sensing as a large-scale solution remains challenging as experiences from deployments have shown the performance of a machine-learned model to suffer when there are changes in the environment, e.g., when furniture is moved or when other objects are added or removed from the environment. We present Rise, a novel solution for enhancing the robustness and performance of learning-based wireless sensing techniques against such changes during a deployment. Rise combines probability and statistical assessments together with anomaly detection to identify samples that are likely to be misclassified and uses feedback on these samples to update a deployed wireless sensing model. We validate Rise through extensive empirical benchmarks by considering 11 representative sensing methods covering a broad range of wireless sensing tasks. Our results show that Rise can identify 92.3% of misclassifications on average. We showcase how Rise can be combined with incremental learning to help wireless sensing models retain their performance against dynamic changes in the operating environment to reduce the maintenance cost, paving the way for learning-based wireless sensing to become capable of supporting long-term monitoring in complex everyday environments.",

Our proposed work aims at leveraging pulse oximeter chips in current-day fitness trackers for real-time continuous monitoring of pH in sweat. We achieve that by fabricating a highly responsive and long-term reusable pH sweat sensor on a flexible material to achieve skin conformity, targeting the sensor to work at the reflected infrared (880nm) and red (660nm) photoplethysmograph (PPG) signal intensities recorded by pulse oximeters. The sensor can be readily mounted atop any wearable with a pulse oximeter. We have successfully demonstrated a low-cost, low-power, highly-responsive and long-term reusable wrist-worn wearable prototype, pH Watch, for real-time continuous monitoring of pH value of sweat. We conducted on-body trials with 10 participants and pH Watch achieves an accuracy of $approx$91%. We also showed that the integration of our sweat sensor does not hinder the pulse oximeter from measuring heart rate and SpOtextsubscript2, and users can continue with their daily activities with motion artifacts removed efficiently from PPG signals using the TROIKA framework, resulting in heart rate and SpOtextsubscript2 measurements with an accuracy of $approx$95% and $approx$96% respectively when validated against commercial finger pulse oximeter measurements. To the best of our knowledge, pH Watch is the first demonstration of a reusable sweat sensor that can be readily integrated into today's smart watches with pulse oximeters, paving the way for ubiquitous sensing of biomarkers.",

Such tasks include simple reporting on streams to sophisticated model building. However, the practicality of these analyses are impeded in several domains because they are faced with a fundamental trade-off between data collection latency and analysis accuracy. In this paper, we first study this trade-off in the context of a specific domain, Cellular Radio Access Networks (RAN). We find that the trade-off can be resolved using two broad, general techniques: intelligent data grouping and task formulations that leverage domain characteristics. Based on this, we present CellScope, a system that applies a domain specific formulation and application of Multi-task Learning (MTL) to RAN performance analysis. It uses three techniques: feature engineering to transform raw data into effective features, a PCA inspired similarity metric to group data from geographically nearby base stations sharing performance commonalities, and a hybrid online-offline model for efficient model updates. Our evaluation shows that CellScope's accuracy improvements over direct application of ML range from 2.5\\texttimes{} to 4.4\\texttimes{} while reducing the model update overhead by up to 4.8\\texttimes{}. We have also used CellScope to analyze an LTE network of over 2 million subscribers, where it reduced troubleshooting efforts by several magnitudes. We then apply the underlying techniques in CellScope to another domain specific problem, mobile phone energy bug diagnosis, and show that the techniques are general.",

However, due to resource contention, network functions can suffer from performance problems that are hard to diagnose. In particular, when many flows traverse a complex topology of NF instances, it is hard to pinpoint root causes for a flow experiencing performance issues such as low throughput or high latency. Simply maintaining resource counters at individual NFs is not sufficient since the effect of resource contention can propagate across NFs and over time. In this paper, we introduce Microscope, a performance diagnosis tool, for network functions that leverages queuing information at NFs to identify the root causes (i.e., resources, NFs, traffic patterns of flows etc.). Our evaluation on realistic NF chains and traffic shows that we can correctly capture root causes behind 89.7% of performance impairments, up to 2.5 times more than the state-of-the-art tools with low overhead.",

                    "abstract": "Accurate tracking of the hands and fingers allows users to employ natural gestures in various interactive applications. Hand tracking also supports health applications, such as monitoring face-touching, a common vector for infectious disease. However, for both types of applications, the utility of hand tracking is often limited by the impracticality of bulky tethered systems (e.g., instrumented gloves) or inherent limitations (e.g., Line of Sight or privacy concerns with vision-based systems). These limitations have severely restricted the adoption of hand tracking in real-world applications. We present MagX, a fully untethered on-body hand tracking system utilizing passive magnets and a novel magnetic sensing platform. Since passive magnets require no maintenance, they can be worn on the hands indefinitely, and only the sensor board needs recharging, akin to a smartwatch.We used MagX to conduct a series of experiments, finding a wearable sensing array can achieve millimeter-accurate 5 DoF tracking of two magnets independently. For example, at 11 cm distance, a 6cm \\texttimes{} 6cm sensing array can achieve positional and orientational errors of 0.76 cm and 0.11 rad. At 21 cm distance, the tracking errors are 2.65 cm and 0.41 rad. MagX can leverage larger sensor arrays for improved long-distance tracking, e.g., a 9.8cm \\texttimes{} 9.8cm array can achieve 2.62 cm and 0.55 rad tracking performance on two magnets at 27 cm distance. The robust performance can facilitate ubiquitous adoption of magnetic tracking in various applications. Finally, MagX can perform all compute locally and only requires 0.38W total (220mW on the sensor platform plus 159mW on the computing unit) to perform real-time tracking, offering \"all day\" fully untethered operation on a typical smartwatch-sized battery.",

In this paper, we develop a novel acoustic imaging system using only an off-the-shelf smartphone. It is an attractive alternative to camera based imaging under darkness and obstruction. Our system is based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). To image an object, a user moves a phone along a predefined trajectory to mimic a virtual sensor array. SAR based imaging poses several new challenges in our context, including strong self and background interference, deviation from the desired trajectory due to hand jitters, and severe speaker/microphone distortion. We address these challenges by developing a 2-stage interference cancellation scheme, a new algorithm to compensate trajectory errors, and an effective method to minimize the impact of signal distortion. We implement a proof-of-concept system on Samsung S7. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of acoustic imaging on a mobile.",

                    "abstract": "Video streaming is crucial for AI applications that gather videos from sources to servers for inference by deep neural nets (DNNs). Unlike traditional video streaming that optimizes visual quality, this new type of video streaming permits aggressive compression/pruning of pixels not relevant to achieving high DNN inference accuracy. However, much of this potential is left unrealized, because current video streaming protocols are driven by the video source (camera) where the compute is rather limited. We advocate that the video streaming protocol should be driven by real-time feedback from the server-side DNN. Our insight is two-fold: (1) server-side DNN has more context about the pixels that maximize its inference accuracy; and (2) the DNN's output contains rich information useful to guide video streaming. We present DDS (DNN-Driven Streaming), a concrete design of this approach. DDS continuously sends a low-quality video stream to the server; the server runs the DNN to determine where to re-send with higher quality to increase the inference accuracy. We find that compared to several recent baselines on multiple video genres and vision tasks, DDS maintains higher accuracy while reducing bandwidth usage by upto 59% or improves accuracy by upto 9% with no additional bandwidth usage.",

DNS misconfiguration related outages have rendered popular services like GitHub, HBO, LinkedIn, and Azure inaccessible for extended periods. This paper introduces GRoot, the first verifier that performs static analysis of DNS configuration files, enabling proactive and exhaustive checking for common DNS bugs; by contrast, existing solutions are reactive and incomplete. GRoot uses a new, fast verification algorithm based on generating and enumerating DNS query equivalence classes. GRoot symbolically executes the set of queries in each equivalence class to efficiently find (or prove the absence of) any bugs such as rewrite loops. To prove the correctness of our approach, we develop a formal semantic model of DNS resolution. Applied to the configuration files from a campus network with over a hundred thousand records, GRoot revealed 109 bugs within seconds. When applied to internal zone files consisting of over 3.5 million records from a large infrastructure service provider, GRoot revealed around 160k issues of blackholing, initiating a cleanup. Finally, on a synthetic dataset with over 65 million real records, we find GRoot can scale to networks with tens of millions of records.",

Different sensors are embedded in the smart phones which are being used in order to extract some features to distinguish different drivers. Experiments are being done with four drivers and the results show that our system can distinguish them with high accuracy of 92% using only one turn.",

To date, however, even the most effective CTC systems require these devices to operate in the same ISM band (eg. 2.4GHz) because of the conventional wisdom that wireless transceivers with different (fundamental) frequencies cannot communicate with one another. In this demo, we present a practical CTC application, called \\o{}ursystem, allowing a 2.4GHz WiFi receiver (eg. a smartphone) to identify UHF RFID tags, which operates at the spectrum between 840~920MHz. \\o{}ursystem leverages the underlying harmonic backscattering of tags to open a second channel and uses it to communicate with WiFi receivers. We design and implement \\o{}ursystem with commodity WiFi chipsets. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that \\o{}ursystem allows WiFi receivers to identify UHF RFID tags within the range of $2$ m and with a median goodput of 95%, which is comparable to today's mobile RFID readers.",

This paper proposes a phone-use monitoring system that detects the driver's handheld phone use and eliminates the distraction at once. Specifically, the proposed system emits periodic ultrasonic pulses to sense if the phone is being held in hand or placed on support surfaces (e.g., seat and cup holder) by capturing the unique signal interference resulted from the contact object's damping, reflection and refraction. We derive the short-time Fourier transform from the microphone data to describe such impacts and develop a CNN-based binary classifier to discriminate the phone use between the handheld and the handsfree status. Additionally, we design a classification error correction filter to correct the classification errors during the monitoring. The experiments with six people, one phone and one car model show that our system achieves 99% accuracy in recognizing handheld phone-use activities.",

The system has the ability to align the sensor readings from wearable devices to the earth coordinate system, ensuring the accuracy and robustness of the system. Experiments with 12 types of exercises involve multiple participants doing both anaerobic and aerobic exercises in indoors as well as outdoors. Our results demonstrate that the proposed system can provide meaningful review and recommendations to users by accurately measure their workout performance and achieve 93% accuracy for workout analysis.",

Recently, software-defined networking (SDN) based architectures (i.e., cockpit network communications environment testing (COMET)) have been proposed for Air-Ground communication. However, an evil can break the communication between a pilot and air traffic control, resulting in a hazardous (or life-threatening) situation up in the air or failure of ground equipment. This paper proposes an efficient evil detection and prevention mechanism (called DoEF) for the COMET architecture. The proposed DoEF utilizes a deep learning-based approach, i.e., long-short term memory (LSTM), to detect the evil flies and provide possible countermeasures. Our preliminary results show that the proposed scheme reduces the detection time and increases the detection accuracy of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks for the aviation network.",

The core functionality of Rushmore is to securely decrypt and display encrypted images (sent by a trusted party) on a mobile device. Although previous approaches have shown that it is possible to securely display encrypted images using TrustZone, they exhibit a critical limitation that significantly hampers the applicability of using TrustZone for display security. The limitation is that, when the trusted domain of TrustZone (the secure world) takes control of the display, the untrusted domain (the normal world) cannot display anything simultaneously. This limitation comes from the fact that previous approaches give the secure world exclusive access to the display hardware to preserve security. With Rushmore, we overcome this limitation by leveraging a well-known, yet overlooked hardware feature called an IPU (Image Processing Unit) that provides multiple display channels. By partitioning these channels across the normal world and the secure world, we enable the two worlds to simultaneously display pixels on the screen without sacrificing security. Furthermore, we show that with the right type of cryptographic method, we can decrypt and display encrypted animated images at 30 FPS or higher for medium-to-small images and at around 30 FPS for large images. One notable cryptographic method we adapt for Rushmore is visual cryptography, and we demonstrate that it is a light-weight alternative to other cryptographic methods for certain use cases. Our evaluation shows that in addition to providing usable frame rates, Rushmore incurs less than 5% overhead to the applications running in the normal world.",

For the communication between peoples, Android smartphones can be used to construct Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). To improve the work efficiency, it is necessary to run the Information Systems (Android Applications) in MANETs, therefore the distribution of information becomes convenient. However, it is very hard to get a real MANET environment to test Android Applications, and so far, we have not found any MANETs simulation environments which can be used to test actual Android Applications. Therefore, we propose a Simulation Experimental Environment for Android Applications in MANETs (SEEM). The test results show that the SEEM is practicable to test Android Applications in MANETs. We believe that the SEEM will be beneficial to the researchers and developers who need to develop and test actual Android Applications in MANETs.",

We envision an innovation through mobile computing technologies to empower such a crowd by enabling them simply to hold their phones up and create a massive collective visualization on top of them. We propose Card-stunt as a Service (CaaS). CaaS is a service enabling a densely packed crowd to instantly visualize symbols using their mobile devices and a server-side service. The key challenge toward realizing an instant collective visualization is how to achieve instant, infrastructure-free, decimeter-level localization of individuals in a massively packed crowd, while maintaining low latency. CaaS addresses the challenges by mobile visible-light angle-of-arrival (AoA) sensing and scalable constrained optimization. It reconstructs relative locations of all individuals and dispatches individualized timed pixels to each one so that they can do their part in the overall visualization. We evaluate CaaS with extensive experiments under diverse reality settings as well as under synthetic workloads scaling up to tens of thousands of people. We deploy CaaS to 49 participants so that they successfully perform a collective visualization cheering up MobiSys.",

Adding new sensing modalities is a cumbersome process because it requires altering the deployed hardware. We introduce passive sensor tags that allow to easily and seamlessly add new sensors to existing IoT deployments without requiring hardware modifications or additional energy sources. Passive sensor tags employ backscatter communication to generate transmissions that can be decoded by the radio transceivers present in today's IoT devices. Furthermore, unlike recent works, our approach does not require dedicated infrastructure to generate the unmodulated carrier used for backscatter communication.The demo showcases our prototype of a passive sensor tag collecting sensor data and delivering it to unmodified commodity IoT devices using passive 802.15.4 transmissions.",

Very short wavelength, high directionality, together with sensitivity to rampant blockages and mobility, however, render state-of-the-art mmWave technologies unsuitable for ubiquitous wireless coverage. In this work, we design and implement UbiG - a mmWave wireless access network - that can deliver ubiquitous gigabits per second wireless access consistently to the commercial-off-the-shelf IEEE 802.11ad devices. UbiG has two key design components: (1) a fast probing based beam alignment algorithm that can identify the best beam consistently with guaranteed latency in a mmWave link, and the algorithm scales well even with a very large number of beams; and (2) an infrastructure-side predictive ranking based fast access point switching algorithm to ensure seamless gigabits per second connectivity under mobility and blockage in a dense mmWave deployment. Our IEEE 802.11ad testbed experiments show that UbiG performs close to an \"Oracle\" solution that instantaneously knows the best beam and access point for gigabits per second data transmission to users.",

Each of the 1.4 billion Android devices relies on the system services of Android Framework to manage applications and system resources. Given its critical role, a vulnerability in the framework can be exploited to launch large-scale cyber attacks and cause severe harms to user security and privacy. Recently, many vulnerabilities in Android Framework were exposed, showing that it is vulnerable and exploitable. However, most of the existing research has been limited to analyzing Android applications, while there are very few techniques and tools developed for analyzing Android Framework. In particular, to our knowledge, there is no previous work that analyzes the framework through symbolic execution, an approach that has proven to be very powerful for vulnerability discovery and exploit generation. We design and build the first system, Centaur, that enables symbolic execution of Android Framework. Due to some unique characteristics of the framework, such as its middleware nature and extraordinary complexity, many new challenges arise and are tackled in Centaur. In addition, we demonstrate how the system can be applied to discovering new vulnerability instances, which can be exploited by several recently uncovered attacks against the framework, and to generating PoC exploits.",

Unfortunately, most existing techniques are ill-suited to wireless characterization, either providing fast but grossly inaccurate results or providing accurate results at the cost of time and bandwidth. To meet this need, we developed Fast Mobile Network Characterization (FMNC). FMNC operates within a web fetch and provides an accurate available bandwidth assessment within 250 ms while consuming less than 100 KB of data. In our demo, we will show the mobile clients for FMNC including apps for Android / iOS, the server back end, and a REST API. We will also show visualization of our ongoing longitudinal dataset of nearly one hundred users.",

The unfavorable propagation characteristics due to short wavelength and high directionality, makes the 60 GHz links highly vulnerable to blockage and mobility. However, the advent of multi-band chipsets opens the possibility of leveraging the more robust WiFi technology to assist 60 GHz in order to provide seamless, Gbps connectivity. In this demonstration, we will present MUST, an 802.11-compliant real-time system that provides seamless, high-speed connectivity over multi-band 60 GHz and WiFi devices. MUST has two key design components: (1) a WiFi-assisted 60 GHz link adaptation algorithm, which can instantaneously predict the best beam and PHY rate setting, with zero probing overhead at 60 GHz; and (2) a proactive blockage detection and switching algorithm which can re-direct ongoing user traffic to the robust interface within sub-10 ms latency.

                    "abstract": "Recent years have seen dramatic advances in low-power neural accelerators that aim to bring deep learning analytics to IoT devices; simultaneously, there have been considerable advances in the design of low-power radios to enable efficient compute offload from IoT devices to the cloud. Neither is a panacea --- deep learning models are often too large for low-power accelerators and bandwidth needs are often too high for low-power radios. While there has been considerable work on deep learning for smartphone-class devices, these methods do not work well for small battery-powered IoT devices that are considerably more resource-constrained.In this paper, we bridge this gap by designing a continuously tunable method for leveraging both local and remote resources to optimize performance of a deep learning model. Clio presents a novel approach to split machine learning models between an IoT device and cloud in a progressive manner that adapts to wireless dynamics. We show that this method can be combined with model compression and adaptive model partitioning to create an integrated system for IoT-cloud partitioning. We implement Clio on the GAP8 low-power neural accelerator, provide an exhaustive characterization of the operating regimes where each method performs best and show that Clio can enable graceful performance degradation as resources diminish.",

Apple's FaceID is arguably the latest of such efforts, at the cost of additional hardware (e.g., dot projector, flood illuminator and infrared camera). We propose a novel user authentication system EchoPrint, which leverages acoustics and vision for secure and convenient user authentication, without requiring any special hardware. EchoPrint actively emits almost inaudible acoustic signals from the earpiece speaker to \"illuminate\" the user's face and authenticates the user by the unique features extracted from the echoes bouncing off the 3D facial contour. To combat changes in phone-holding poses thus echoes, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to extract reliable acoustic features, which are further combined with visual facial landmark locations to feed a binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for final authentication. Because the echo features depend on 3D facial geometries, EchoPrint is not easily spoofed by images or videos like 2D visual face recognition systems. It needs only commodity hardware, thus avoiding the extra costs of special sensors in solutions like FaceID. Experiments with 62 volunteers and non-human objects such as images, photos, and sculptures show that EchoPrint achieves 93.75% balanced accuracy and 93.50% F-score, while the average precision is 98.05%, and no image/video based attack is observed to succeed in spoofing.",

However, such a deployment is infeasible at large scale. To counter this problem, researchers have proposed using ambient RF energy to power up the battery-free tag. In this poster, we evaluate if this ambient RF energy is sufficient to meet the power requirements of a battery-free tag in today's urban and rural areas. We also compare available ambient RF energy across different frequencies. Finally, we discuss open challenges in realising ambient backscatter systems in real-world.",

Customers need to contact customer care to request assistance before these issues are resolved. This paper presents our experience with PACE (<u>P</u>ro<u>A</u>ctive customer <u>C</u>ar<u>E</u>), a novel, proactive system that monitors, troubleshoots and resolves individual service issues, without having to rely on customers to first contact customer care for assistance. PACE seeks to improve customer experience and care operation efficiency by automatically detecting individual (non-outage related) service issues, prioritizing repair actions by predicting customers who are likely to contact care to report their issues, and proactively triggering actions to resolve these issues. We develop three machine learning-based prediction models, and implement a fully automated system that integrates these prediction models and takes resolution actions for individual customers. We conduct a large-scale trace-driven evaluation using real-world data collected from a major cellular carrier in the US, and demonstrate that PACE is able to predict customers who are likely to contact care due to non-outage related individual service issues with high accuracy. We further deploy PACE into this cellular carrier network. Our field trial results show that PACE is effective in proactively resolving non-outage related individual customer service issues, improving customer experience, and reducing the need for customers to report their service issues.",

                    "abstract": "Increasingly, vehicles sold today are connected cars: they offer vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity through built-in WiFi and cellular interfaces, and they act as mobile hotspots for devices in the vehicle. We study the connection quality available to connected cars today, focusing on user-facing, latency-sensitive applications. We find that network latency varies significantly and unpredictably at short time scales and that high tail latency substantially degrades user experience. We also find an increase in coverage options available due to commercial WiFi offerings and that variations in latency across network options are not well-correlated. Based on these findings, we develop RAVEN, an in-kernel MPTCP scheduler that mitigates tail latency and network unpredictability by using redundant transmission when confidence about network latency predictions is low. RAVEN has several novel design features. It operates transparently, without application modification or hints, to improve interactive latency. It seamlessly supports three or more wireless networks. Its in-kernel implementation allows proactive cancellation of transmissions made unnecessary through redundancy. Finally, it explicitly considers how the age of measurements affects confidence in predictions, allowing better handling of interactive applications that transmit infrequently and networks that exhibit periods of temporary poor performance. Results from speech, music, and recommender applications in both emulated and live vehicle experiments show substantial improvement in application response time.",

Generally, heterogeneous nodes deployed for precision agriculture where these nodes generated an extensive amount of data. Then machine learning can be used to analyze this data for precision agriculture. However, most of the IoT devices are resource-constrained devices, which results in poor performance while conducting a machine learning task. Thus, in SeamFarm, we consider distributing the data as well as the task to all available nodes. The results show that SeamFarm can meet all of the functional and non-functional requirements of distributed data analytic for precision agriculture. Moreover, it can obtain faster data analytic results.",

In this demonstration1 we present WiART, an augmented reality framework to help visualize and interact with wireless network activities in real time. WiART collects real-time radio and network statistics from participating network devices and depicts them on users' mobile devices in an intuitive way, leveraging the virtual information overlay of augmented reality. Specifically in our current implementation, WiART takes inputs from a cognitive radio link controlling beam-steerable reconfigurable antennas and annotates on a live mobile screen the active pre-measured radiation patterns. In the reverse flow, WiART enables users to select desired antenna radiation patterns directly in the mobile app and observe their effects on link performance in real time. These capabilities add an unprecedented level of instant visualization and interaction with wireless activities and provides valuable insights into the dynamics of a reconfigurable antenna-based cognitive radio network.",

From our extensive measurements, the Channel Activity Detection (CAD) feature that is recently introduced to LoRa for energy-efficiently detecting preamble chirps, can also detect payload chirps reliably. This sheds light on an efficient carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) protocol that we call LMAC for LoRa networks. This paper presents the designs of three advancing versions of LMAC that respectively implements CSMA, balances the communication loads among the channels defined by frequencies and spreading factors based on the end nodes' local information and then additionally the gateway's global information. Experiments on a 50-node lab testbed and a 16-node university deployment show that, compared with ALOHA, LMAC brings up to 2.2\\texttimes{} goodput improvement and 2.4\\texttimes{} reduction of radio energy per successfully delivered frame. Thus, should the LoRaWAN's ALOHA be replaced with LMAC, network performance boosts can be realized.",

Unfortunately, the community have limited understanding of the prevalence, characteristics, and root causes of unresponsiveness. In this paper, we make an in-depth study of ANR and SNR at scale based on fine-grained system-level traces crowdsourced from 30,000 Android systems. We find that ANR and SNR occur prevalently on all the studied 15 hardware models, and better hardware does not seem to relieve the problem. Moreover, as Android evolves from version 7.0 to 9.0, there are fewer ANR events but more SNR events. Most importantly, we uncover multifold root causes of ANR and SNR and pinpoint the largest inefficiency which roots in Android's flawed implementation of Write Amplification Mitigation (WAM). We design a practical approach to eliminating this largest root cause; after large-scale deployment, it reduces almost all (&gt;99%) ANR and SNR caused by WAM while only decreasing 3% of the data write speed. In addition, we document important lessons we have learned from this study, and have also released our measurement code/data to the research community.",

RF-Echo introduces a custom-designed active RF reflector ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) fabricated in a 180nm CMOS process which echoes a frequency-shifted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal originally generated from an anchor. The proposed technique is based on time-of-flight (ToF) estimation in the frequency domain that effectively eliminates inter-carrier and inter-symbol interference in multipath-rich indoor NLOS channels. RF-Echo uses a relatively narrow bandwidth of $leq$80 MHz which does not require an expensive very high sampling rate analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Unlike ultra-wideband (UWB) systems, the active reflection scheme is designed to operate at a relatively low carrier frequency that can penetrate building walls and other blocking objects for challenging NLOS scenarios. Since the bandwidth at lower frequencies (2.4 GHz and sub-1 GHz) is severely limited, we propose novel signal processing algorithms as well as machine learning techniques to significantly enhance the localization resolution given the bandwidth constraint of the proposed system. The newly fabricated tag IC consumes 62.8 mW active power. The software defined radio (SDR) based anchor prototype is rapidly deployable without the need for accurate synchronization among anchors and tags. Field trials conducted in a university building confirm up to 85 m operation with decimeter accuracy for robust 2D localization.",

To reduce the cost of sensing model training data collection, CrossSense employs machine learning to train, off-line, a roaming model that generates from one set of measurements synthetic training samples for each target environment. To scale up to a larger problem size, CrossSense adopts a mixture-of-experts approach where multiple specialized sensing models, or experts, are used to capture the mapping from diverse WiFi inputs to the desired outputs. The experts are trained offline and at runtime the appropriate expert for a given input is automatically chosen. We evaluate CrossSense by applying it to two representative WiFi sensing applications, gait identification and gesture recognition, in controlled single-link environments. We show that CrossSense boosts the accuracy of state-of-the-art WiFi sensing techniques from 20% to over 80% and 90% for gait identification and gesture recognition respectively, delivering consistently good performance - particularly when the problem size is significantly greater than that current approaches can effectively handle.",

However, existing temperature measurement devices are bulky, cost-prohibitive, or battery-powered, making item-level sensing and intelligence costly. In this paper, we present a novel tag-based thermometer called Thermotag, which uses a common passive RFID tag to sense the temperature with competitive advantages of being low-cost, battery-free, and robust to environmental conditions. The basic idea of Thermotag is that the resistance of a semiconductor diode in a tag's chip is temperature-sensitive. By measuring the discharging period through the reverse-polarized diode, we can estimate the temperature indirectly. We propose a standards-compliant measurement scheme of the discharging period by using a tag's volatile memory and build a mapping model between the discharging period and temperature for accurate and reliable temperature sensing. We implement Thermotag using a commercial off-the-shelf RFID system, with no need for any firmware or hardware modifications. Extensive experiments show that the temperature measurement has a large span ranging from 0 \u00b0C to 85 \u00b0C and a mean error of 2.7 \u00b0C.",

Unfortunately, establishing multi-stream directional links can be a high overhead procedure as the search space increases with the number of spatial streams and the product of AP-client beam resolution. In this paper, we present MUlti-stream beam-Training for mm-wavE networks (MUTE) a novel system that leverages channel sparsity, GHz-scale sampling rate, and the knowledge of mm-Wave RF codebook beam patterns to construct a set of candidate beams for multi-stream beam steering. In 60 GHz WLANs, the AP establishes and maintains a directional link with every client through periodic beam training. MUTE repurposes these beam acquisition sweeps to estimate the Power Delay Profile (PDP) of each beam with zero additional overhead. Coupling PDP estimates with beam pattern knowledge, MUTE selects a set of candidate beams that capture diverse or ideally orthogonal paths to obtain maximum stream separability. Our experiments demonstrate that MUTE achieves 90% of the maximum achievable aggregate rate while incurring only 0.04% of exhaustive search's training overhead.",

Given the ambiguity inherent in such text, it is not surprising that protocol implementations have long exhibited bugs. In this paper, we apply natural language processing (NLP) to effect semi-automated generation of protocol implementations from specification text. Our system, Sage, can uncover ambiguous or under-specified sentences in specifications; once these are clarified by the author of the protocol specification, Sage can generate protocol code automatically.Using Sage, we discover 5 instances of ambiguity and 6 instances of under-specification in the ICMP RFC; after fixing these, Sage is able to automatically generate code that interoperates perfectly with Linux implementations. We show that Sage generalizes to sections of BFD, IGMP, and NTP and identify additional conceptual components that Sage needs to support to generalize to complete, complex protocols like BGP and TCP.",

These multi-application, multi-tenant devices provide users with more options, and application developers with a standard platform. Typical ultra-low-power wearable devices, however, lack the type of hardware memory protection mechanisms~-- such as Memory Management Units (MMU)~-- needed to safely separate applications. At best, they provide a Memory Protection Unit (MPU), which allows the user to configure read/write/execute permissions for a few distinct regions of memory. At worst, no hardware memory protection is provided. MPU capabilities vary across hardware platforms, with many shortcomings: (1)~the MPU may only support a few distinct memory regions (fewer than one per application), (2)~the MPU may not protect all regions of memory, like hardware registers, and (3)~MPU protection boundary rules can be arcane, because they depend on opaque hardware implementations. Our key observation is that by supplementing a limited segment MPU with runtime checks, and using compile-time static analysis to explicitly layout applications in memory, we can guarantee application isolation (sandboxing) even on these limited MPUs, with lower overhead than software-only solutions.",

                    "abstract": "Over the last decade, facial landmark tracking and 3D reconstruction have gained considerable attention due to their numerous applications such as human-computer interactions, facial expression analysis, and emotion recognition, etc. Traditional approaches require users to be confined to a particular location and face a camera under constrained recording conditions (e.g., without occlusions and under good lighting conditions). This highly restricted setting prevents them from being deployed in many application scenarios involving human motions. In this paper, we propose the first single-earpiece lightweight biosensing system, BioFace-3D, that can unobtrusively, continuously, and reliably sense the entire facial movements, track 2D facial landmarks, and further render 3D facial animations. Our single-earpiece biosensing system takes advantage of the cross-modal transfer learning model to transfer the knowledge embodied in a high-grade visual facial landmark detection model to the low-grade biosignal domain. After training, our BioFace-3D can directly perform continuous 3D facial reconstruction from the biosignals, without any visual input. Without requiring a camera positioned in front of the user, this paradigm shift from visual sensing to biosensing would introduce new opportunities in many emerging mobile and IoT applications. Extensive experiments involving 16 participants under various settings demonstrate that BioFace-3D can accurately track 53 major facial landmarks with only 1.85 mm average error and 3.38% normalized mean error, which is comparable with most state-of-the-art camera-based solutions. The rendered 3D facial animations, which are in consistency with the real human facial movements, also validate the system's capability in continuous 3D facial reconstruction.",

We conduct a large-scale measurement campaign on appname, an operational mobile video telephony service. Our analysis shows that the application-layer video codec and transport-layer protocols remain highly uncoordinated, which represents one major reason for the low QoE. We thus propose name, a machine learning based framework to resolve the issue. We train name with the massive data traces from the measurement campaign using a custom-designed imitation learning algorithm, which enables name to learn from past experience following an expert's iterative demonstration/supervision. We have implemented and incorporated name into the appname. Our experiments show that name outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, improving video quality while reducing stalling time by multi-folds under various practical scenarios.",

                    "abstract": "Cloud services are deployed in datacenters connected though high-bandwidth Wide Area Networks (WANs). We find that WAN traffic negatively impacts the performance of datacenter traffic, increasing tail latency by 2.5x, despite its small bandwidth demand. This behavior is caused by the long round-trip time (RTT) for WAN traffic, combined with limited buffering in datacenter switches. The long WAN RTT forces datacenter traffic to take the full burden of reacting to congestion. Furthermore, datacenter traffic changes on a faster time-scale than the WAN RTT, making it difficult for WAN congestion control to estimate available bandwidth accurately.We present Annulus, a congestion control scheme that relies on two control loops to address these challenges. One control loop leverages existing congestion control algorithms for bottlenecks where there is only one type of traffic (i.e., WAN or datacenter). The other loop handles bottlenecks shared between WAN and datacenter traffic near the traffic source, using direct feedback from the bottleneck. We implement Annulus on a testbed and in simulation. Compared to baselines using BBR for WAN congestion control and DCTCP or DCQCN for datacenter congestion control, Annulus increases bottleneck utilization by 10% and lowers datacenter flow completion time by 1.3-3.5x.",

HRTFs produce distinct sound patterns that ultimately help the brain infer the spatial properties of the sound, such as its direction of arrival, \ud835\udf03. If an earphone can learn the HRTF, it could apply the HRTF to any sound and make that sound appear directional to the user. For instance, a directional voice guide could help a tourist navigate a new city. While past works have estimated human HRTFs, an important gap lies in personalization. Today's HRTFs are global templates that are used in all products; since human HRTFs are unique, a global HRTF only offers a coarse-grained experience. This paper shows that by moving a smartphone around the head, combined with mobile acoustic communications between the phone and the earbuds, it is possible to estimate a user's personal HRTF. Our personalization system, UNIQ, combines techniques from channel estimation, motion tracking, and signal processing, with a focus on modeling signal diffraction on the curvature of the face. The results are promising and could open new doors into the rapidly growing space of immersive AR/VR, earables, smart hearing aids, etc.",

                    "abstract": "To take advantage of Visible Light Communication (VLC) for low-power applications, such as IoT tags, researchers have been developing systems to modulate (backscatter) ambient light using LC shutters. Various approaches have been explored for single-pixel transmitters, but without following a principled approach. This has resulted in either relatively low data rates, short ranges, or the need for powerful artificial light sources. This paper takes a step back and proposes a more theoretical framework: ChromaLux. By considering the fundamental characteristics of liquid crystals (birefringence and thickness), we demonstrate that the design space is way larger than previously explored, allowing for much better systems. In particular, we uncover the existence of a transient state where the switching time can be reduced by an order of magnitude without lowering the contrast significantly, improving both range and data rate. Using a prototype, we demonstrate that our framework is applicable to different LCs. Our results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art single-pixel systems, achieving ranges of 50 meters at 1 kbps and with bit-error-rates below 1%.",

                    "abstract": "Temperature sensor is one of the most widespread technologies in the IoT era. Wireless temperature monitoring systems are convenient to deploy and can drive mass applications in the fields of smart home, transportation and logistics. Currently, wireless temperature monitoring products are based on microelectronic and semiconductor components, which are not cost-effective (e.g., a few dollars) and more importantly, generate electronic wastes. In this work, we present ThermoWave, a new paradigm of wireless temperature monitoring that is ecological, battery-less, and ultra-low cost. Specifically, ThermoWave is on the basis of the thermal scattering effect on millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals. Specifically, cholesteryl materials align their molecular patterns at different environmental temperatures, and this temperature-induced pattern change will be modulated and sensed by the scattered mmWave signals. There are three functional modules in the ThermoWave system. The ThermoTag is a cholesteryl material inked film or paper tag that can be conveniently attached to the object of interest to monitor temperature changes. Each ThermoTag costs less than 0.01 dollars. The temperature modulated mmWave scattering will be received by a mmWave-radar based ThermoScanner and demodulated by a software-based temperature decoder ThermoSense, which includes a model-based method (i.e., ThermoDot) for point temperature estimation and a data-driven method (i.e., ThermoNet) for thermal imaging. We prototype and evaluate the ThermoWave system performance in both controlled and real-world setups. Experimental results show that the ThermoWave achieves the precision of \u00b11.0\u00b0F in the range of 30\u00b0F to 120\u00b0F in a controlled setup. We also investigate the performance in real-world applications, and the ThermoWave can reach the \u00b13.0\u00b0F precision in the temperature estimation. We also test and discuss sustainability, durability, robustness, and cost-effectiveness of the ThermoWave in both design and experiments.",

                    "abstract": "Despite years of innovative research and development, gigabit-speed 60 GHz wireless networks are still not mainstream. The main concern for network operators and vendors is the unfavorable propagation characteristics due to short wavelength and high directionality, which renders the 60 GHz links highly vulnerable to blockage and mobility. However, the advent of multi-band chipsets opens the possibility of leveraging the more robust WiFi technology to assist 60 GHz in order to provide seamless, Gbps connectivity. In this paper, we design and implement MUST, an IEEE 802.11-compliant system that provides seamless, high-speed connectivity over multi-band 60 GHz and WiFi devices. MUST has two key design components: (1) a WiFi-assisted 60 GHz link adaptation algorithm, which can instantaneously predict the best beam and PHY rate setting, with zero probing overhead; and (2) a proactive blockage detection and switching algorithm which can re-direct ongoing user traffic to the robust interface within sub-10 ms latency. Our experiments with off-the-shelf 802.11 hardware show that MUST can achieve 25-60% throughput gain over state-of-the-art solutions, while bringing almost 2 orders of magnitude cross-band switching latency improvement.",

It is supported through software-defined radio access networking (SD-RAN), bringing programmability to the network in order to enhance performance according to the needs of slice owners. However, SD-RAN so far remained limited to a mere reconfiguration of the base station. In this work, we demonstrate a prototype of a service-oriented RAN on top of the OpenAirInterface and Mosaic5G platforms that brings programmability and extensibility to the RAN with a range of network applications for the purpose of intelligent slicing. We implemented a slice control and management framework, and plug a traffic analysis application that significantly improves the performance of slice users. We observe an improvement of 30% in application round-trip time with negligible variability for the considered traffic. Further, we demonstrate how to extend control plane functionality from a network store to improve slice performance.",

Due to its unobtrusive and ubiquitous nature, it is gaining popularity among people everywhere. Due to the ease of use, the utility of such technology is increasing day by day. However, in theworld of researchers, the accurate estimation of heart rate (HR) in presence of motion artefacts remains an unsolved problem due to the susceptibility of PPG signals to corruption by motion artefacts. The way in which a person fastens the device on the wrist plays an important role in the acquisition of signal from the device. While there are various research works going on in this field, there is always a trade-off between accuracy and complexity of algorithm and hardware resources. Also, in such scenarios where the sensor gets misplaced due to movements, there might be no PPG signal component available in the acquired signal data. In such cases the sophisticated denoising algorithms make no sense.",

In this work, we present Magneto, a magnetic field based app classification mechanism. Magneto captures the Hall effect due to energy consumption by different components in a smartphone, and fingerprints apps based on data captured with a Hall sensor, and a phone magnetometer. We demonstrate that our mechanism can identify magnetic field changes due to varying levels of energy consumption. We further show that Magento can not only classify between apps in the same scenario, but also can tell apart scenarios when the phone is being charged (with an AC adapter, wireless charger, or powerbank) or not. We perform validation experiments with 5 different apps, and achieve ~85% accuracy with 3 Android apps, subject to 3 different charging scenarios.",

However, prior work examining root DNS suggests anycast deployments incur significant inflation, with users often routed to suboptimal sites. We reassess anycast performance, first extending prior analysis on inflation in the root DNS. We show that inflation is very common in root DNS, affecting more than 95% of users. However, we then show root DNS latency emph{hardly matters} to users because caching is so effective. These findings lead us to question: is inflation inherent to anycast, or can inflation be limited when it matters? To answer this question, we consider Microsoft's anycast CDN serving latency-sensitive content. Here, latency matters orders of magnitude more than for root DNS. Perhaps because of this need, only 35% of CDN users experience any inflation, and the amount they experience is smaller than root DNS. We show that CDN anycast latency has little inflation due to extensive peering and engineering. These results suggest prior claims of anycast inefficiency reflect experiments on a single application rather than anycast's technical potential, and they demonstrate the importance of context when measuring system performance.",

After examining the problem from both the user and phone sides, we discovered the cause of these unexpected shutoffs to be a large and dynamic internal voltage drop of the phone battery, which is, in turn, caused by the dynamics of both battery's internal resistance and the phone's discharge current. To fix these unexpected shutoffs, we design a novel Battery-aware Power Management (BPM) middleware that accounts for these dual-dynamics in phone operation. Specifically, BPM profiles the battery's internal resistance --- which varies with battery state-of-charge (SoC), temperature, and aging --- using a novel duty-cycled charging method. BPM then regulates, at run-time, the phone's discharge current based on the constructed battery profile. We have implemented and evaluated BPM on 4 commodity smartphones from different OEMs with the latest battery firmware, demonstrating that BPM prevents unexpected phone shutoffs and extends their operation time by 1.16--2.03X. Our user study, which includes 121 mobile phone users, also corroborates BPM's usefulness/attractiveness.",

And even when they are available, understanding why a CCA underperforms by trawling through massive amounts of statistical data from network connections is challenging. The history of congestion control is replete with many examples of surprising and unanticipated behaviors unseen in simulation but observed on real-world paths. In this paper, we propose initial steps toward modeling and improving our confidence in a CCA's behavior. We have developed CCAC, a tool that uses formal verification to establish certain properties of CCAs. It is able to prove hypotheses about CCAs or generate counterexamples for invalid hypotheses. With CCAC, a designer can not only gain greater confidence prior to deployment to avoid unpleasant surprises, but can also use the counterexamples to iteratively improvetheir algorithm. We have modeled additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease (AIMD), Copa, and BBR with CCAC, and describe some surprising results from the exercise.",

                    "abstract": "Virtualized Radio Access Network (vRAN) offers a cost-efficient solution for running the 5G RAN as a virtualized network function (VNF) on commodity hardware. The vRAN is more efficient than traditional RANs, as it multiplexes several base station workloads on the same compute hardware. Our measurements show that, whilst this multiplexing provides efficiency gains, more than 50% of the CPU cycles in typical vRAN settings still remain unused. A way to further improve CPU utilization is to collocate the vRAN with general-purpose workloads. However, to maintain performance, vRAN tasks have sub-millisecond latency requirements that have to be met 99.999% of times. We show that this is difficult to achieve with existing systems. We propose Concordia, a userspace deadline scheduling framework for the vRAN on Linux. Concordia builds prediction models using quantile decision trees to predict the worst case execution times of vRAN signal processing tasks. The Concordia scheduler is fast (runs every 20 us) and the prediction models are accurate, enabling the system to reserve a minimum number of cores required for vRAN tasks, leaving the rest for general-purpose workloads. We evaluate Concordia on a commercial-grade reference vRAN platform. We show that it meets the 99.999% reliability requirements and reclaims more than 70% of idle CPU cycles without affecting the RAN performance.",

Unfortunately, most of the state-of-the-art sign recognition technologies are limited by either high energy consumption or expensive device costs and have a difficult time providing a real-time service in a daily-life environment. Inspired by previous works on motion detection with wearable devices, we propose Sign Speaker - a real-time, robust, and user-friendly American sign language recognition (ASLR) system with affordable and portable commodity mobile devices. SignSpeaker is deployed on a smartwatch along with a smartphone; the smartwatch collects the sign signals and the smartphone outputs translation through an inbuilt loudspeaker. We implement a prototype system and run a series of experiments that demonstrate the promising performance of our system. For example, the average translation time is approximately $1.1$ seconds for a sentence with eleven words. The average detection ratio and reliability of sign recognition are 99.2% and 99.5%, respectively. The average word error rate of continuous sentence recognition is 1.04% on average.",

Our analysis not only gathers simple flows that have a single source and a single sink, but also Multi-Flows that either start from a single source and flow to multiple sinks, or start from multiple sources and flow to a single sink. This analysis captures more complex behavior that both recent malware and recent benign applications exhibit. We leverage N-gram analysis to understand both unique and common behavioral patterns present in Multi-Flows. Our tool leverages N-gram analysis over sequences of API calls that occur along control flow paths in Multi-Flows to precisely analyze Multi-Flows with respect to app behavior.",

This impedes system manageability, growth, and overall provisioning. In turn, large-scale content providers are forced to use staggering numbers of addresses, ultimately leading to address exhaustion (IPv4) and inefficiency (IPv6).In this paper, we revisit IP bindings, entirely. We attempt to evolve addressing conventions by decoupling IP in DNS and from network sockets. Alongside technologies such as SNI and ECMP, a new architecture emerges that ``unbinds'' IP from services and servers, thereby returning IP's role to merely that of reachability. The architecture is under evaluation at a major CDN in multiple datacenters. We show that addresses can be generated randomly emph{per-query}, for 20M+ domains and services, from as few as ~4K addresses, 256 addresses, and even emph{one} IP address. We explain why this approach is transparent to routing, L4/L7 load-balancers, distributed caching, and all surrounding systems -- and is emph{highly desirable}. Our experience suggests that many network-oriented systems and services (e.g., route leak mitigation, denial of service, measurement) could be improved, and new ones designed, if built with addressing agility.",

Such non-flexible thresholding has been introduced mainly due to ED's incapability of differentiating Wi-Fi frames from LTE frames. As a remedy, we design and develop an LAA-LTE transmitter based on a software-defined radio system proposing lightweight but effective Wi-Fi frame detection with which an LAA-LTE device can capture a Wi-Fi preamble by only using LTE's own time-domain samples. Experiments confirm the efficacy of the developed system.",

Previous work studied the problem via controlled experiments, while a systematic and in-depth investigation in the wild is still missing. To bridge the gap, we conduct a large-scale measurement campaign on appname, an operational mobile video telephony service. Our measurement logs fine-grained performance metrics over 1 million video call sessions. Our analysis shows that the application-layer video codec and transport-layer protocols remain highly uncoordinated, which represents one major reason for the low QoE. We thus propose name, a machine learning based framework to resolve the issue. Instead of blindly following the transport layer's estimation of network capacity, name reviews historical logs of both layers, and extracts high-level features of codec/network dynamics, based on which it determines the highest bitrates for forthcoming video frames without incurring congestion. To attain the ability, we train name with the aforementioned massive data traces using a custom-designed imitation learning algorithm, which enables name to learn from past experience. We have implemented and incorporated name into appname. Our experiments show that name outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, improving video quality while reducing stalling time by multi-folds under various practical scenarios.",

Unfortunately, P4 programs tend to be monolithic and tightly coupled to the hardware architecture, which makes it hard to write programs in a portable and modular way---e.g., by composing reusable libraries of standard protocols.To address this challenge, we present the design and implementation of a novel framework (\u03bcP4) comprising a lightweight logical architecture that abstracts away from the structure of the underlying hardware pipelines and naturally supports powerful forms of program composition. Using examples, we show how enables modular programming. We present a prototype of the compiler that generates code for multiple lower-level architectures, including Barefoot's Tofino Native Architecture. We evaluate the overheads induced by our compiler on realistic examples.",

                    "abstract": "The cellular networking ecosystem is being radically transformed by openness, softwarization, and virtualization principles, which will steer NextG networks toward solutions running on \"white box\" infrastructures. Telco operators will be able to truly bring intelligence to the network, dynamically deploying and adapting its elements at run time according to current conditions and traffic demands. Deploying intelligent solutions for softwarized NextG networks, however, requires extensive prototyping and testing procedures, currently largely unavailable. To this aim, this paper introduces SCOPE, an open and softwarized prototyping platform for NextG systems. SCOPE is made up of: (i) A ready-to-use, portable open-source container for instantiating softwarized and programmable cellular network elements (e.g., base stations and users); (ii) an emulation module for diverse real-world deployments, channels and traffic conditions for testing new solutions; (iii) a data collection module for artificial intelligence and machine learning-based applications, and (iv) a set of open APIs for users to control network element functionalities in real time. Researchers can use SCOPE to test and validate NextG solutions over a variety of large-scale scenarios before implementing them on commercial infrastructures. We demonstrate the capabilities of SCOPE and its platform independence by prototyping exemplary cellular solutions in the controlled environment of Colosseum, the world's largest wireless network emulator. We then port these solutions to indoor and outdoor testbeds, namely, to Arena and POWDER, a PAWR platform.",

To mitigate this privacy threat, we have developed HideScreen by utilizing the human vision and optical system properties to hide the users' on-screen information from the shoulder surfers.Specifically, HideScreen discretizes the device screen into grid patterns to neutralize the low-frequency components so that the on-screen information will \"blend into'' the background when viewed from the outside of the designed range. We have developed and evaluated several ways of hiding both on-screen texts and images from shoulder surfers. Our extensive experimental evaluation of HideScreen demonstrates its high protection rates (&gt;96% for texts and &gt;99% for images) while providing good user experience.",

It has diverse uses such as testing water contamination, measuring alcohol concentration in drinks, and identifying the presence of protein in urine to detect the onset of kidney failure. Today, measurements of surface tension are done in a lab environment using costly instruments, making it hard to leverage this property in ubiquitous applications. In contrast, we show how to measure surface tension using only a smartphone. We introduce a new algorithm that uses the small waves on the liquid surface as a series of lenses that focus light and generate a characteristic pattern. We then use the phone camera to capture this pattern and measure the surface tension. Our approach is simple, accurate and available to anyone with a smartphone. Empirical evaluations show that our mobile app can detect water contamination and measure alcohol concentration. Furthermore, it can track protein concentration in the urine, providing an initial at-home test for proteinuria, a dangerous complication that can lead to kidney failure.",

Moreover, ePat also explores the impacts of various contexts and benefits during the evolving process. Our ePat as a comprehensive investigation of the electric taxi network mobility and charging evolving has the potential to advance the understanding of the evolving patterns of electric taxi networks and pave the way for analyzing future shared autonomous vehicles.",

On the other hand, as 5G has been deployed for only a few months, it is unclear how well and whether 5G can eventually meet its prospects. In this paper, we demystify operational 5G networks through a first-of-its-kind cross-layer measurement study. Our measurement focuses on four major perspectives: (i) Physical layer signal quality, coverage and hand-off performance; (ii) End-to-end throughput and latency; (iii) Quality of experience of 5G's niche applications (e.g., 4K/5.7K panoramic video telephony); (iv) Energy consumption on smartphones. The results reveal that the 5G link itself can approach Gbps throughput, but legacy TCP leads to surprisingly low capacity utilization (&lt; 32%), latency remains too high to support tactile applications and power consumption escalates to 2 - 3x over 4G. Our analysis suggests that the wireline paths, upper-layer protocols, computing and radio hardware architecture need to co-evolve with 5G to form an ecosystem, in order to fully unleash its potential.",

We develop Millimetro in the context of autonomous driving to efficiently localize roadside infrastructure such as lane markers and road signs, even if obscured from view, where visual sensing fails. While RF-based localization offers a natural solution, current ultra-low-power localization systems struggle to operate accurately at extended ranges under strict latency requirements. Millimetro addresses this challenge by re-using existing automotive radars that operate at mmWave frequency where plentiful bandwidth is available to ensure high accuracy and low latency. We address the crucial free space path loss problem experienced by signals from the tag at mmWave bands by building upon Van Atta Arrays that retro-reflect incident energy back towards the transmitting radar with minimal loss and low power consumption. Our experimental results indoors and outdoors demonstrate a scalable system that operates at a desirable range (over 100 m), accuracy (centimeter-level), and ultra-low-power (&lt; 3 uW).",

                    "abstract": "Wi-Fi based sensing systems, although sound as being deployed almost everywhere there is Wi-Fi, are still practically difficult to be used without explicit adaptation efforts to new data domains. Various pioneering approaches have been proposed to resolve this contradiction by either translating features between domains or generating domain-independent features at a higher learning level. Still, extra training efforts are necessary in either data collection or model re-training when new data domains appear, limiting their practical usability. To advance cross-domain sensing and achieve fully zero-effort sensing, a domain-independent feature at the lower signal level acts as a key enabler. In this paper, we propose Widar3.0, a Wi-Fi based zero-effort cross-domain gesture recognition system. The key insight of Widar3.0 is to derive and estimate velocity profiles of gestures at the lower signal level, which represent unique kinetic characteristics of gestures and are irrespective of domains. On this basis, we develop a one-fits-all model that requires only one-time training but can adapt to different data domains. We implement this design and conduct comprehensive experiments. The evaluation results show that without re-training and across various domain factors (i.e. environments, locations and orientations of persons), Widar3.0 achieves 92.7% in-domain recognition accuracy and 82.6%-92.4% cross-domain recognition accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art solutions. To the best of our knowledge, Widar3.0 is the first zero-effort cross-domain gesture recognition work via Wi-Fi, a fundamental step towards ubiquitous sensing.",

The first category operates with off-the-shelf narrowband RFID tags but makes restrictive assumptions on the environment or the tag's movement patterns. The second category does not make such restrictive assumptions; however, it requires designing new ultra-wideband hardware for RFIDs and uses the large bandwidth to directly compute a tag's 3D location. Hence, while the first category is restrictive, the second one requires replacing the billions of RFIDs already produced and deployed annually. This paper presents RFind, a new technology that brings the benefits of ultra-wideband localization to the billions of RFIDs in today's world. RFind does not require changing today's passive narrowband RFID tags. Instead, it leverages their underlying physical properties to emulate a very large bandwidth and uses it for localization. Our empirical results demonstrate that RFind can emulate over 220MHz of bandwidth on tags designed with a communication bandwidth of only tens to hundreds of kHz, while remaining compliant with FCC regulations. This, combined with a new super-resolution algorithm over this bandwidth, enables RFind to perform 3D localization with sub-centimeter accuracy in each of the x/y/z dimensions, without making any restrictive assumptions on the tag's motion or the environment.",

                    "abstract": "Task-based distributed frameworks (e.g., Ray, Dask, Hydro) have become increasingly popular for distributed applications that contain asynchronous and dynamic workloads, including asynchronous gradient descent, reinforcement learning, and model serving. As more data-intensive applications move to run on top of task-based systems, collective communication efficiency has become an important problem. Unfortunately, traditional collective communication libraries (e.g., MPI, Horovod, NCCL) are an ill fit, because they require the communication schedule to be known before runtime and they do not provide fault tolerance.We design and implement Hoplite, an efficient and fault-tolerant collective communication layer for task-based distributed systems. Our key technique is to compute data transfer schedules on the fly and execute the schedules efficiently through fine-grained pipelining. At the same time, when a task fails, the data transfer schedule adapts quickly to allow other tasks to keep making progress. We apply Hoplite to a popular task-based distributed framework, Ray. We show that Hoplite speeds up asynchronous stochastic gradient descent, reinforcement learning, and serving an ensemble of machine learning models that are difficult to execute efficiently with traditional collective communication by up to 7.8x, 3.9x, and 3.3x, respectively.",

Mitigating microsleep's consequences require an unobtrusive, reliable, and socially acceptable microsleep detection solution throughout the day, every day. Unfortunately, existing solutions do not meet these requirements.In this paper, we propose a novel behind-the-ear wearable device for microsleep detection, called WAKE. WAKE detects microsleep by monitoring biosignals from the brain, eye movements, facial muscle contractions, and sweat gland activities from behind the user's ears. In particular, we introduce a Three-fold Cascaded Amplifying (3CA) technique to tame the motion artifacts and environmental noises for capturing high fidelity signals. The behind-the-ear form factor is motivated by the fact that bone-conductance headphones, which are worn around the ear, are becoming widely used. This technology trend gives us an opportunity to enable a wide range of cognitive monitoring and improvement applications by integrating more sensing and actuating functionality into the ear-phone, making it a smarter one.Through our prototyping, we show that WAKE can suppress motion and environmental noise in real-time by 9.74-19.47 dB while walking, driving, or staying in different environments ensuring that the biosignals are captured reliably. We evaluated WAKE against gold-standard devices on 19 sleep-deprived and narcoleptic subjects. The Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation results show the feasibility of WAKE in microsleep detection on an unseen subject with average precision and recall of 76% and 85%, respectively.",

However, the practical adoption of enterprise mobility is very much in its in fancy, and seemingly has barriers. We posit that these barriers include heavy user-burden in accomplishing tasks (e.g. number of actions required to execute a workflow), high cost of mobile access (e.g. latency for content fetching), and irrelevance of available mobile functions (e.g. mobile app defeaturization done inappropriately).The novelty of our research is in a unified observe-patternize-mimic paradigm we explore to address these barriers, based on a simple question: could patterns in user-behavior be learned, and leveraged for reducing user-burden? If patterns are discovered, then we show that intelligent mimicking of these patterns at appropriate junctures can considerably relieve the mobile user burden. We motivate this paradigm through three application scenarios representing read, write, and act usage modalities.",

Our main focus is the use in a vehicular networking environment, where field testing and real world experimentation is becoming more relevant these days. Large Field Operational Tests (FOTs) are expensive and difficult to handle in terms of reproducibility and controllability -- particularly for application development and integration tests for automotive Electronic Control Units (ECUs). To support such experiments, we developed an approach to integrate a real system to test into a large scale simulation scenario without the need to change the physical and access layer parts of the communication stack of this system. We closely followed the Hardware In The Loop (HIL) simulation concept but also integrated a wireless communication channel into the picture. LAN Radio is building upon the well established and Open Source development platform OpenWRT to provide optimal extensibility.",

It will consider later efforts in promoting the technology in regions that it had not reached earlier. There will be consideration not only the technical development, but also the political climate which either encouraged or prevented its take-up. Moreover, the importance of personal networks at many stages of the story will be highlighted. I will consider why the first Arpanet service node was sited at UCL, how it grew to provide an international heterogeneous interconnection service until the late '80s, and how this differed from other European developments. This will include the governance put in place, the role of the Open Systems Interconnection rise and fall in Europe, and the growth of multi- agency support on both sides of the Atlantic. In parallel with the development of a UK-US service, an International Collaboration Board (ICB) was formed that fostered unclassified collaborations between certain European and American NATO defence departments. While the ICB was not very significant technically, how its success initiated broader US-European Internet extension will be described. Our emphasis on application services to the '90s will be outlined - message, directory, security and multimedia conferencing. Finally we will treat briefly the start of international networking in India around 1990, and the bringing the academics of Central Asia and the Caucasus into the Internet community.",

Yet, specialized hardware remains the preferred implementation choice for the wireless physical layer. This is primarily due to the tight latency requirements and high bandwidth demanded by operations at the wireless PHY, as opposed to the network-layer. This poster argues that in the era of low-power Internet of Things, virtualization of physical layer functions deserves a revisit. We specifically study low-power Internet of Things technologies that present a ripe opportunity for cloudification of wireless network functions, with their lower bandwidths and lax latency constraints. We present our vision of how physical layer function virtualization should be structured to maximize benefits and performance. We present a feasibility study on the latency and scalability limits of such virtualization for various physical layer functions that could leverage such an architecture.",

Unlike capacitive sensing, it does not require conductive materials and compared to audio sensing it is more robust to acoustic noise. In VibKeyboard, the received vibration signals are determined by the location of the touch impact. This allows location discrimination of touches precise enough to enable emerging applications such as virtual keyboards on ubiquitous surfaces for mobile devices. VibKeyboard seeks to extract unique features in frequency domain embedded in the vibration signal attenuation and interference and perform fine grained localization. Our experimental results demonstrate that VibKeyboard could accurately recognize keystrokes from close-by keys on a nearby virtual keyboard.",

Traditional video transport protocols, represented by a few deterministic rules, can hardly adapt to the heterogeneous and highly dynamic modern Internet. Emerging learning-based algorithms have demonstrated potential to meet the challenge. However, our measurement study reveals an alarming long tail performance issue: these algorithms tend to be bottle-necked by occasional catastrophic events due to the built-in exploration mechanisms. In this work, we propose Loki, which improves the robustness of learning-based model by coherently integrating it with a rule-based algorithm. To enable integration at feature level, we first reverse-engineer the rule-based algorithm into an equivalent \"black-box\" neural network. Then, we design a dual-attention feature fusion mechanism to fuse it with a reinforcement learning model. We train Loki in a commercial real-time video system through online learning, and evaluate it over 101 million video sessions, in comparison to state-of-the-art rule-based and learning-based solutions. The results show that Loki improves not only the average but also the tail performance substantially (26.30% to 44.24% reduction of stall rate and 1.76% to 2.17% increase in video throughput at 95-percentile).",

They provision necessary control states at the device and network nodes to enable data access. However, the current design may suffer from long data access latency even under good radio conditions. The fundamental problem is that, data-plane packet delivery cannot start or resume until all control-plane procedures are completed, and these control procedures run sequentially by design. We show both are more than necessary under popular use cases. We design DPCM, which reduces data access latency through parallel processing approaches and exploiting device-side state replica. We implement DPCM and validate its effectiveness with extensive evaluations.",

First, we use an autoencoder to project high-dimensional context data (traffic and signal quality patterns) into a latent representation. Then, we use a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm based on an actor-critic neural network structure and a classifier to map (encoded) contexts into resource control decisions. We have implemented vrAIn using an open-source LTE stack over different platforms. Our results show that vrAIn successfully derives appropriate compute and radio control actions irrespective of the platform and context: (i) it provides savings in computational capacity of up to 30% over CPU-unaware methods; (ii) it improves the probability of meeting QoS targets by 25% over static allocation policies using similar CPU resources in average; (iii) upon CPU capacity shortage, it improves throughput performance by 25% over state-of-the-art schemes; and (iv) it performs close to optimal policies resulting from an offline oracle. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that thoroughly studies the computational behavior of vRANs, and the first approach to a model-free solution that does not need to assume any particular vRAN platform or system conditions.",

Though many smart speakers have appeared in the market, we do not know the exact performance of smart speakers. In particular, when we call a smart speaker to issue a voice command, we recognize that the smart speaker is ready when it turns its LED lamps on. The wake-up response time is important for improving user experience. Therefore, we have to measure the wake-up response time, which requires the video analysis of smart speaker LED's status for the voice command. In this work, we present a smart speaker wake-up response time measurement method with a camera. We record video files with camera while testing a smart speaker and analyze image similarity to find a wake-up event. For this purpose, we use the Google Inception-v3 model to improve the accuracy of detecting the image change of a small area.",

Most prior in-air tapping schemes use customized depth-cameras and therefore have the limitations of low accuracy and high latency. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained depth-aware tapping scheme that can provide high accuracy tapping detection. Our basic idea is to use light-weight ultrasound based sensing, along with one COTS mono-camera, to enable 3D tracking of user's fingers. The mono-camera is used to track user's fingers in the 2D space and ultrasound based sensing is used to get the depth information of user's fingers in the 3D space. Using speakers and microphones that already exist on most AR/VR devices, we emit ultrasound, which is inaudible to humans, and capture the signal reflected by the finger with the microphone. From the phase changes of the ultrasound signal, we accurately measure small finger movements in the depth direction. With fast and light-weight ultrasound signal processing algorithms, our scheme can accurately track finger movements and measure the bending angle of the finger between two video frames. In our experiments on eight users, our scheme achieves a 98.4% finger tapping detection accuracy with FPR of 1.6% and FNR of 1.4%, and a detection latency of 17.69ms, which is 57.7ms less than video-only schemes. The power consumption overhead of our scheme is 48.4% more than video-only schemes.",

However, due to the computing fluctuations inherent to wireless dynamics and resource contention in shared computing infrastructure, the price to migrate from dedicated to shared platforms may be too high. Indeed, we show in this paper that the baseline architecture of a base station's distributed unit (DU) collapses upon moments of deficit in computing capacity. Recent solutions to accelerate some signal processing tasks certainly help but do not tackle the core problem: a DU pipeline that requires predictable computing to provide carrier-grade reliability.We present Nuberu, a novel pipeline architecture for 4G/5G DUs specifically engineered for non-deterministic computing platforms. Our design has one key objective to attain reliability: to guarantee a minimum set of signals that preserve synchronization between the DU and its users during computing capacity shortages and, provided this, maximize network throughput. To this end, we use techniques such as tight deadline control, jitter-absorbing buffers, predictive HARQ, and congestion control. Using an experimental prototype, we show that Nuberu attains &gt;95% of the theoretical spectrum efficiency in hostile environments, where state-of-art approaches lose connectivity, and at least 80% resource savings.",

Regarding the design of acoustic communication, throughput and inaudibility are the most vital aspects, which greatly affect available applications that can be supported and their user experience. Existing studies on acoustic communication either use audible frequency band (e.g., &lt;20kHz) to achieve a relatively high throughput or realize inaudibility using near-ultrasonic frequency band (e.g., 18-20kHz) which however can only achieve limited throughput. Leveraging the non-linearity of microphones, voice commands can be demodulated from the ultrasound signals, and further recognized by the speech recognition systems. In this poster, we design an acoustic communication system, which achieves high-throughput and inaudibility at the same time, and the highest throughput we achieve is over 17x higher than the state-of-the-art acoustic communication systems.",

However, for a robust localization using a least-squares approach, ADS-B messages have to be collected over a long time. We propose a localization method based on matching the received signal with known ADS-B messages from distributed receivers. Our proposed method only requires three seconds of recording. Compared to satellite-based localization methods, this approach also works indoors as the signals sent by aircraft are much stronger.",

                    "abstract": "Cellular operators want to be able to deploy small cells with the same ease as WiFi access points, to quickly address traffic hotspots in dense urban areas. However, deploying small cells has not been easy. The reason is that due to scarcity of licensed spectrum, small cells need to use the same spectrum as the existing macro cells, and they need to explicitly coordinate their spectrum usage with each other to manage interference. The challenge is that this coordination needs to happen with latencies less than a millisecond, otherwise adding small cells does not help scale the overall network capacity. Implementing such tight coordination in dense urban deployments has not been easy in practice.We present QuickC, a wireless transport technology that can simplify small cell deployment. QuickC enables small cells to coordinate with their neighboring macro and small cells with sub-1ms latencies over the operator's licensed spectrum but in a way that the users of this spectrum are negligibly affected. QuickC is designed to be an \"add on\" to existing cellular networks and does not require any invasive changes to the existing infrastructure or standards. We implement QuickC on a commodity system on chip from Texas Instruments used for building commercial cellular baseband and show that it can consistently deliver latencies less than 0.6 ms between neighboring cells. We also use system-level simulations to evaluate the wide-area impact of deploying QuickC in current networks, and show that it can deliver 5--10 Mbps of bandwidth between neighboring cells while causing less than 1--4% throughput degradation to the existing users of the spectrum.",

DeepRadar makes decisions in real-time and maintains continuous operability by adapting its computations based on the available computing resources. We thoroughly evaluate DeepRadar using a variety of test data at different signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) levels. Our evaluation results show that at 20 dB peak-to-average SIR, per MHz, DeepRadar detects radar signals with 99% accuracy and misses only less than 2 MHz, on average, while estimating their spectral occupancy. Our implementation of DeepRadar using a commercial-off-the-shelf software-defined radio also achieves a similarly high detection accuracy.",

Live streaming marries the rich detail of video with the timeliness of live transmission and the ease of use of consumer cameras, thus promising to vastly increase the amount of detailed, up-to-the minute information available about the real world. The volume of potentially interesting footage brings up the question of how end-users can avoid being glued to one (or worse, many) streams of videos waiting for events of interest. In this demo, we present Lookout, a system that allows users to register standing queries, called triggers over live video streams. Lookout then notifies the user when events of interest to them occur in their streams of interest. For example, a user could point to a cat cam and write a trigger that sends a notification when the cat wakes up and starts moving. Users can also write triggers to look for certain news being covered in a live new channel, a gamer moving to a certain level in a Twitch stream, a stranger showing up in a outdoor surveillance camera, etc.",

In addition, the millimeter-wave (mmWave) base station is expected to be included in existing heterogeneous networks. In this regard, we present a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) based resource allocation strategy for mobile devices in heterogeneous vehicular networks, which suffer from shortage issue of shared frequency band. The downlink throughput of each mobile device is cooperatively enhanced by the proposed MADRL method, and thus each mobile device associates with a base station and uses a frequency band within low delay.",

These cameras commonly employ motion sensors to identify that something is occurring in their fields of vision before starting to record and notifying the property owner of the activity. In this paper, we discover that the motion sensing action can disclose the location of the camera through a novel wireless camera localization technique we call MotionCompass. In short, a user who aims to avoid surveillance can find a hidden camera by creating motion stimuli and sniffing wireless traffic for a response to that stimuli. With the motion trajectories within the motion detection zone, the exact location of the camera can be then computed. We develop an Android app to implement MotionCompass. Our extensive experiments using the developed app and 18 popular wireless security cameras demonstrate that for cameras with one motion sensor, MotionCompass can attain a mean localization error of around 5 cm with less than 140 seconds. This localization technique builds upon existing work that detects the existence of hidden cameras, to pinpoint their exact location and area of surveillance.",

Beacon and probe responses can be extended by adding additional information (so-called beacon stuffing) making it possible to deliver this information to mobile devices (e.g. smart-phones equipped with 802.11 interfaces) without the need for association with the local infrastructure. This feature can be used to support location-based information services (LBS) related for e.g. advertising local opportunities, temporary obstacles and traffic disturbances or emergency notifications. In this paper we introduce a demonstrator for Location-based Wi-Fi Services (LoWS) based on beacon stuffing. The LoWS system can be easily installed within an existent 802.11 infrastructure while the receiver application can be installed on nearly all up-to-date commercial off-the-shelf smartphones, e.g. based on Android or iOS.",

But such devices barely support any user interaction, even for simple tasks such as menu selection and single-character input. In this paper, we design Inkput, a simple passive interface attached to the unexploited backside of the headset to enable touch sensing. Inkput is a piece of paper substrate with carbon ink patterns printed atop. It leverages the column of electrodes near the edge of the smartphone touchscreen to sense multi-touch on the 2D space, and is even able to locate finger hovering. Our experiments demonstrate that Inkput can precisely detect touch positions with mm-level precision. Our case studies in actual VR applications also verify that Inkput can support common VR interactions and can even outperform high-end handheld controllers in terms of efficiency.",

While coalescing storage and networking security scheme can reduce redundent and unnecessary operations, we identify security- and system-level challenges that can occur when applying DTLS. FDTLS addresses these challenges by employing asymmetric key generation, a virtual peer, and header reduction-based storage optimization. Our results obtained using a Contiki-based implementation on OpenMote platforms show that compared to using storage and networking security separately, FDTLS can reduce the latency of packet transmission responses and also contribute to saving energy.",

To improve users' experiences, caching at the wireless access points (APs) has been proposed for bringing the contents closer to users. However, the wireless content placement is challenging as the placement is affected by many realistic constraints, such as a large number of APs, interaction among neighboring APs, various local content popularities. In this paper, we study the wireless caching problem, i.e., which contents should be stored by which APs. First, we fulfil these constraints to formulate our problem and introduce an objective function that maximizes the total cache hit rate of all APs. Next, we prove the NP-hardness of the problem and propose a local distributed caching algorithm to address it. Furthermore, we provide a game theoretic perspective on the problem and prove that the proposed algorithm can converge to the Nash Equilibrium in polynomial time. Finally, we perform simulations on a real-world dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.",

A virtual access point layer consisting of fixed virtual satellite network attachment points is superimposed over the physical topology in order to hide the mobility of satellites from the mobile endpoints. Then the MSN enhances endpoint mobility by a clean separation of identity and logical network location through an identity-to-location resolution service, and taking full advantage of the user's geographical location information. Moreover, a SDN based implementation is presented to further illustrate the proposal.",

While this new platform is highly configurable, featuring FPGA SoCs and frequency agile transceivers capable of operation from 50 MHz to 3.8 GHz, it is also highly compact and power efficient, enabling a complete 160 radio base station in less than 2 cubic feet. ArgosV3 is currently being deployed in a campus-wide multi-cell many-antenna network.

Unfortunately, establishing and managing highly directional beams in THz networks is challenging as links lack the \"pseudo-omni\" reception capability of lower bands and the product of AP-client beam resolution is high due to narrow beams of only a few degrees. In this paper, we present One-shot Path discovEry with a THz RAinbow (OPERA), a novel system that identifies dominant paths between the AP and all clients in order to efficiently steer directional beams. The key idea is to embed path direction into the inherent characteristics of signals traveling along each path. To do so, we exploit a single leaky wave antenna and create a THz Rainbow. A THz Rainbow transmission consists of distinct signals with unique spectral characteristics across the angular domain. Leveraging the spatial-spectral signatures in the THz Rainbow, all receivers can correlate the measured signal with the known transmission signatures to discover the sender's path directions in one-shot. Our experiments demonstrate that OPERA achieves average direction estimates within 2\u00b0 of ground truth for LOS and reflected paths.",

However, they also pose unprecedented challenges in delivering seamless Internet service for on-board passengers. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale active-passive measurement study of TCP performance over LTE on HSR. Our measurement targets the HSR routes in China operating at above 300 km/h. We performed extensive data collection through both controlled setting and passive monitoring, obtaining 1732.9 GB data collected over 135719 km of trips. Leveraging such a unique dataset, we measure important performance metrics such as TCP goodput, latency, loss rate, as well as key characteristics of TCP flows, application breakdown, and users' behaviors. We further quantitatively study the impact of frequent cellular handover on HSR networking performance, and conduct in-depth examination of the performance of two widely deployed transport-layer protocols: TCP CUBIC and TCP BBR. Our findings reveal the performance of today's commercial HSR networks \"in the wild'', as well as identify several performance inefficiencies, which motivate us to design a simple yet effective congestion control algorithm based on BBR to further boost the throughput by up to 36.5%. They together highlight the need to develop dedicated protocol mechanisms that are friendly to extreme mobility.",

Further, the selected electrochemical NO2 sensor was effective, confirming that NO2 concentrations were high on weekdays (during heavy traffic) and low at night.",

In many countries, cellular networks provide the most reliable, highest bandwidth, and greatest coverage option for internet access. Repurposing smartphones as gateways could extract value from hundreds of millions of devices currently considered to be e-waste. While these factors make smartphones a seemingly ideal platform to serve as a gateway between sensors and the cloud, we find that a device designed for multi-tenant operation and frequent human interaction becomes unreliable when tasked to continuously run a single application with no human interaction, a somewhat counter-intuitive result. Further, we find that economy phones cannot physically withstand continuous operation, resulting in a surprisingly high rate of permanent device failures in the field. If these observations hold more broadly, they would make mobile phones poorly suited to a range of sensing applications for which they have been rumored to hold great promise.",

The backscatter design of GateScatter is an economic option towards pervasive Internet connectivity for ever-growing IoT. The carefully designed tag optimally reshapes ZigBee IoT packets with an arbitrary payload into an 802.11b WiFi packet over the air, such that the payload can be reliably retrieved at the WiFi receiver (hence a gateway). Gate-Scatter is highly compatible - it works with a wide range of IEEE 802.15.4-compliant systems, is agnostic to upper layer proprietary protocols, and does not require any modification to the commodity IoT platforms. GateScatter is extended to BLE IoT for generality. We prototype GateScatter hardware on FPGA where the wide applicability is demonstrated through evaluations on five popular IoT devices including Samsung SmartThings sensor, Philips smart bulb, and Amazon Echo Plus. Further extensive evaluations show that GateScatter consistently achieves throughput above 200 kbps and range of over 27 m under diverse practical scenarios including a corridor, dormitory room, and under user mobility.",

The sensor powers up by harvesting energy from RF signals and communicates at near-zero power via backscatter. In contrast to prior designs which cannot operate across various in-body environments, our sensor can self-reconfigure to adapt to different tissues and channel conditions. This adaptation is made possible by two key innovations: a reprogrammable antenna that can tune its energy harvesting resonance to surrounding tissues, and a backscatter rate adaptation protocol that closes the feedback loop by tracking circuit-level sensor hints.We built our design on millimeter-sized integrated chips and flexible antenna substrates, and tested it in environments that span both in-vitro (fluids) and ex-vivo (tissues) conditions. Our evaluation demonstrates \u03bcmedIC's ability to tune its energy harvesting resonance by more than 200 MHz (i.e., adapt to different tissues) and to scale its bitrate by an order of magnitude up to 6Mbps, allowing it to support higher data rate applications (such as streaming low-res images) without sacrificing availability. This rate adaptation also allows \u03bcmedIC to scale its energy consumption by an order of magnitude down to 350 nanoWatts. These capabilities pave way for a new generation of networked micro-implants that can adapt to complex and time-varying in-body environments.",

The large scale and diversity of networks, their complex dependencies, and continuous evolution through technology and software updates combined with the risk of service impact create tremendous challenges to effectively manage changes. In this paper, we use data from a large service provider and experiences of their operations teams to highlight the need for quick and easy adaptation of change management capabilities and keep up with the continuous network changes. We propose a new framework CORNET (COmposition fRamework for chaNge managEmenT) with key ideas of modularization of changes into building blocks, flexible composition into change workflows, change plan optimization, change impact verification, and automated translation of high-level change management intent into low-level implementations and mathematical models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CORNET using real-world data collected from 4G and 5G cellular networks and virtualized services such as VPN and SDWAN running in the cloud as well as experiments conducted on a testbed of virtualized network functions. We also share our operational experiences and lessons learned from successfully using CORNET within a large service provider network over the last three years.",

Tagyro uses a closed-form model to transform the run-time phase offsets between tags into orientation angle, and addresses the unexpected deviation of phase measurement distorted by imperfect radiation pattern of practical tags. We have implemented a real-time version of Tagyro on a commodity RFID system. In this demo, we show that Tagyro can handle the phase distortion by sensing the effective layout tag array, an use the sensed layout to track the orientation of objects in high accuracy.",

We explore the use of LCS in location-enhanced server authentication, which traditionally relies on certificates. Given recent incidents involving certificate authorities, various techniques to strengthen server authentication were proposed. They focus on improving the certificate validation process, such as pinning, revocation, or multi-path probing. In this paper, we propose using the server's geographic location as a second factor of its authenticity. Our solution, SALVE, achieves location-based server authentication by using secure DNS resolution and by leveraging LCS for location measurements. We develop a TLS extension that enables the client to verify the server's location in addition to its certificate. Successful server authentication therefore requires a valid certificate and the server's presence at a legitimate geographic location, e.g., on the premises of a data center. SALVE prevents server impersonation by remote adversaries with mis-issued certificates or stolen private keys of the legitimate server. We develop a prototype implementation and our evaluation in real-world settings shows that it incurs minimal impact to the average server throughput. Our solution is backward compatible and can be integrated with existing approaches for improving server authentication in TLS.",

In this paper, we present SeCloak, an ARM TrustZone-based solution that ensures reliable on-off control of peripherals even when the platform software is compromised. We design a secure kernel that co-exists with software running on mobile devices (e.g., Android and Linux) without requiring any code modifications. An Android prototype demonstrates that mobile peripherals like radios, cameras, and microphones can be controlled reliably with a very small trusted computing base and with minimal performance overhead.",

We propose a new wearable ADM system that could be used daily by real-world users. It is designed in a form of necklace, providing natural and firm contact of sensor on user's skin to accurately capture eating activities. At our preliminary experiments, our wearable ADM system detected eating of a user with 86.1% accuracy.",

These alerts include AMBER alerts, severe weather alerts, and (unblockable) Presidential Alerts, intended to inform the public of imminent threats. Recently, a test Presidential Alert was sent to all capable phones in the United States, prompting concerns about how the underlying WEA protocol could be misused or attacked. In this paper, we investigate the details of this system, and develop and demonstrate the first practical spoofing attack on Presidential Alerts, using both commercially available hardware as well as modified open source software. Our attack can be performed using a commercially-available software defined radio, and our modifications to the open source NextEPC and srsLTE software libraries. We find that with only four malicious portable base stations of a single Watt of transmit power each, almost all of a 50,000-seat stadium can be attacked with a 90% success rate. The true impact of such an attack would of course depend on the density of cell phones in range; fake alerts in crowded cities or stadiums could potentially result in cascades of panic. Fixing this problem will require a large collaborative effort between carriers, government stakeholders, and cell phone manufacturers. To seed this effort, we also discuss several defenses to address this threat in both the short and long term.",

These models are typically constructed using expensive techniques such as manual annotation with 3D modeling tools, extrapolated from satellite or aerial photography, or using specialized hardware with depth sensing devices. In this work, we show that 3D urban maps can be extracted from standard GNSS data, by analyzing the received satellite signals that are attenuated by obstacles, such as buildings. Furthermore, we show that these models can be extracted from low-accuracy GNSS data, crowdsourced opportunistically from standard smartphones during their user's uncontrolled daily commute trips, unleashing the potential of applying the principle to wide areas. Our proposal incorporates position inaccuracies in the calculations, and accommodates different sources of variability of the satellite signals' SNR. The diversity of collection conditions of crowdsourced GNSS positions is used to mitigate bias and noise from the data. A binary classification model is trained and evaluated on multiple urban scenarios using data crowdsourced from over 900 users. Our results show that the generalization accuracy for a Random Forest classifier in typical urban environments lies between 79% and 91% on 4 m wide voxels, demonstrating the potential of the proposed method for building 3D maps for wide urban areas.",

BatMapper operates by emitting sound signal and capturing its reflections by two microphones on smartphones. We develop robust probabilistic echo-object association and outlier removal algorithms to identify the correspondence between distances and objects, thus the geometry of corridors. We compensate minute hand sway movements to identify small surface recessions, thus detecting doors automatically. Additionally, we leverage structure cues in indoor environments for user trace calibration. The demo will enable any person to hold the smartphone and walk along a corridor to map the corridor shape and detect doors in real-time.",

We demonstrate that LiSteer maintains beam alignment at the narrowest beamwidth level even in case of device mobility, without incurring any training overhead at mobile devices. Our extensive evaluation on a custom dual-band hardware platform comprising highly directional horn antennas as well as practical phased antenna arrays with electronic beam steering shows that LiSteer achieves direction estimates within 2.5 degrees of ground truth on average. Moreover, it achieves beam steering accuracy of more than 97% while in tracking mode, without incurring any client beam training or feedback overhead.",

In this work, we seek to propose a novel near-field communication protocol, MagneComm, which utilizes Magnetic Induction (MI) signals emitted from CPUs and captured by magnetometers on mobile devices for communication. Since CPUs and magnetometers are readily available components in mobile devices, MagneComm eliminates the requirement for special hardware and complements existing near-field communication protocols by providing additional bandwidth. We systematically analyze the characteristics of magnetic signals of CPUs and facilitate MagneComm with one-way communication, full-duplex communication, and multi-transmitter schemes in accordance with the hardware availability on devices. We prototype MagneComm on both laptops and smartphones. Extensive evaluation results show that MagneComm achieves up to 110bps within 10cm.",

Recent floor plan construction work crowdsources mobile sensing data from smartphone users for scalability. However, they incur long time (e.g., weeks or months) and tremendous efforts in data collection, and many rely on images thus suffering technical and privacy limitations. In this paper, we propose BatMapper, which explores a previously untapped sensing modality -- acoustics -- for fast, fine grained and low cost floor plan construction. We design sound signals suitable for heterogeneous microphones on commodity smartphones, and acoustic signal processing techniques to produce accurate distance measurements to nearby objects. We further develop robust probabilistic echo-object association, recursive outlier removal and probabilistic resampling algorithms to identify the correspondence between distances and objects, thus the geometry of corridors and rooms. We compensate minute hand sway movements to identify small surface recessions, thus detecting doors automatically. Experiments in real buildings show BatMapper achieves 1-2cm distance accuracy in ranges up around 4m; a 2-3 minute walk generates fine grained corridor shapes, detects doors at 92% precision and 1~2m location error at 90-percentile; and tens of seconds of measurement gestures produce room geometry with errors &lt;0.3m at 80-percentile, at 1-2 orders of magnitude less data amounts and user efforts.",

In this paper, we describe MicroMobile, a system for deploying short data-gathering experiments to an extremely diverse set of users via mobile advertising. We conduct experiments in three mediums: interactive advertisements, mobile browsers, and native applications on both major mobile operating systems.We use MicroMobile to demonstrate how researchers can use mobile advertising to recruit users, for as little as $1.50 per completed experiment. Across almost 500 completed experiments, we found that interactive ads have the highest participation rate (and thus lowest cost), which was 2x the participation rate of browser experiments and more than 6x native app experiments. Users were also highly diverse, spanning age, income, and ethnicity. While native apps are the most powerful platform, they constitute the most expensive targets. However, as mobile browsers add sensor APIs, browser-based experimentation has increasing applicability.",

A \"Skinpatch\" software-defined radio (SDR) receiver is realized on a commercial USRP running GNU Radio programs. It down-converts the reflected waves from the Neurograins and performs data recovery.

By leveraging the multitude, geographical dispersion, and technical abilities of smartphones, these services tackle challenging tasks by harnessing the power of the crowd. One such service, Crowd GPS, has gained traction in the industry and research community alike, materializing as a class of systems that track lost objects or individuals (e.g., children or elders). While these systems can have significant impact, they suffer from major privacy threats.In this paper, we highlight the inherent risks to users from the centralized designs adopted by such services and demonstrate how adversaries can trivially misuse one of the most popular crowd GPS services to track their users. As an alternative, we present Techu, a privacy-preserving crowd GPS service for tracking Bluetooth tags. Our architecture follows a hybrid decentralized approach, where an untrusted server acts as a bulletin board that collects reports of tags observed by the crowd, while observers store the location information locally and only disclose it upon proof of ownership of the tag. Techu does not require user authentication, allowing users to remain anonymous. As no user authentication is required and cloud messaging queues are leveraged for communication between users, users remain anonymous. Our security analysis highlights the privacy offered by Techu, and details how our design prevents adversaries from tracking or identifying users. Finally, our experimental evaluation demonstrates that Techu has negligible impact on power consumption, and achieves superior effectiveness to previously proposed systems while offering stronger privacy guarantees.",

We show that these high frequency sounds can be designed to become recordable by unmodified microphones, while remaining inaudible to humans. The core idea lies in exploiting non-linearities in microphone hardware. Briefly, we design the sound and play it on a speaker such that, after passing through the microphone's non-linear diaphragm and power-amplifier, the signal creates a \"shadow\" in the audible frequency range. The shadow can be regulated to carry data bits, thereby enabling an acoustic (but inaudible) communication channel to today's microphones. Other applications include jamming spy microphones in the environment, live watermarking of music in a concert, and even acoustic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. This paper presents BackDoor, a system that develops the technical building blocks for harnessing this opportunity. Reported results achieve upwards of 4kbps for proximate data communication, as well as room-level privacy protection against electronic eavesdropping.",

To address such needs, we develop a novel acoustic based device-free tracking system, called Strata, to enable a user to interact with a nearby device by simply moving his finger. In Strata, a mobile (e.g., smartphone) transmits known audio signals at inaudible frequency, and analyzes the received signal reflected by the moving finger to track the finger location. To explicitly take into account multipath propagation, the mobile estimates the channel impulse response (CIR), which characterizes signal traversal paths with different delays. Each channel tap corresponds to the multipath effects within a certain delay range. The mobile selects the channel tap corresponding to the finger movement and extracts the phase change of the selected tap to accurately estimate the distance change of a finger. Moreover, it estimates the absolute distance of the finger based on the change in CIR using a novel optimization framework. We then combine the absolute and relative distance estimates to accurately track the moving target. We implement our tracking system on Samsung Galaxy S4 mobile phone. Through micro-benchmarks and user studies, we show that our system achieves high tracking accuracy and low latency without extra hardware.",

                    "abstract": "Testing and verification have emerged as key tools in the battle to improve the reliability of networks and the services they provide. However, the success of even the best technology of this sort is limited by how effectively it is applied, and in today's enormously complex industrial networks, it is surprisingly easy to overlook particular interfaces, routes, or flows when creating a test suite. Moreover, network engineers, unlike their software counterparts, have no help to battle this problem\u2014there are no metrics or systems to compute the quality of their test suites or the extent to which their networks have been verified.To address this gap, we develop a general framework to define and compute network coverage for stateless network data planes. It computes coverage for a range of network components (EG, interfaces, devices, paths) and supports many types of tests (e.g., concrete versus symbolic; local versus end-to-end; tests that check network state versus those that analyze behavior). Our framework is based on the observation that any network dataplane component can be decomposed into forwarding rules and all types of tests ultimately exercise these rules using one or more packets.We build a system called Yardstick based on this framework and deploy it in Microsoft Azure. Within the first month of its deployment inside one of the production networks, it uncovered several testing gaps and helped improve testing by covering 89% more forwarding rules and 17% more network interfaces.",

With our approach, the excitation signal is reflected, modulated and shifted to lie in the frequency band of the OFDM subcarrier by the tag; OFDMA is realized by coordinating tags to convey information to the receiver with orthogonal subcarriers concurrently through backscatter. The crux of the design is to achieve strict synchronization among communication components, which is more challenging than in regular OFDMA systems due to the more prominent hardware diversity and uncertainty for backscattering. We reveal how the subtle asychnronization scenarios particularly for backscattering can incur system offsets, and present a series of novel designs for the excitation signal transmitter, tag, and receiver to address the issue. We build a prototype in 802.11g OFDM framework to validate our design. Experimental results show that our system can achieve 5.2-16Mbps aggregate throughput by allowing 48 tags to transmit concurrently, which is 1.45-5x capacity and 48x concurrency compared with the existing design respectively. We also design an OFDMA tag IC, and the simulation and numerical analysis results show that the tag's power consumption is in tens of \u03bcW.",

This imposes new requirements on the design of cellular core networks. A key component of the cellular core is the control plane. Time to complete control plane operations (e.g. mobility handoff, service establishment) directly impacts the delay experienced by end-user applications. In this paper, we design Neutrino, a cellular control plane that provides users an abstraction of reliable access to cellular services while ensuring lower latency. Our testbed evaluations based on real cellular control traffic traces show that Neutrino provides an improvement in control procedure completion times by up to 3.1x without failures, and up to 5.6x under control plane failures, over existing cellular core proposals. We also show how these improvements translate into improving end-user application performance: for AR/VR applications and self-driving cars, Neutrino performs up to 2.5x and up to 2.8x better, respectively, as compared to existing EPC.",

                    "abstract": "We report a 30-month nationwide deployment and operation study of an indoor arrival detection system based on Bluetooth Low Energy called VALID in 364 Chinese cities. VALID is pilot-studied, deployed, and operated in the wild to infer real-time indoor arrival status of couriers, and improve their status reporting behavior based on the detection. During its full nationwide operation (2018/12- 2021/01), VALID consists of virtual devices at 3 million shops and restaurants, where 530,859 of them are in multi-story malls and markets to infer and influence 1 million couriers' behavior, and assist the scheduling of 3.9 billion orders for 186 million customers. Although indoor arrival detection is straightforward in controlled environments, the scale of our platform makes the cost prohibitively high. In this work, we explore to use merchants' smartphones under their consent as a virtual infrastructure to design, build, deploy, and operate VALID from in-lab conception to nationwide operation in three phases for 30 months. We consider metrics including system evolution, reliability, utility, participation, energy, privacy, monetary benefits, along with couriers' behavior changes. We share three lessons and their implications for similar wireless sensing or communication systems with large geospatial operations.",

A passive communication system such as backscatter is desirable. However, existing backscatter systems cannot achieve all of the above requirements. In this paper, we present the first LTE backscatter (LScatter) system that leverages the continuous LTE ambient traffic for ubiquitous, high throughput and low latency backscatter communication. Our design is motivated by our observation that LTE ambient traffic is continuous (v.s. bursty and intermittent WiFi/LoRa traffic), which makes LTE ambient traffic a perfect signal source of a backscatter system. Our design addresses practical issues such as time synchronization, phase modulation, as well as phase offset elimination. We extensively evaluated our design using a testbed of backscatter hardware and USRPs in multiple real-world scenarios. Results show that our LScatter's performance is consistently orders of magnitude better than WiFi backscatter in all the above scenarios. For example, LScatter's throughput is 13.63Mbps, which is 368 times higher than the latest ambient WiFi backscatter system [54]. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our system using two real-world applications.",

Future AR apps impose an explored challenging workload: i) concurrent execution of multiple Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for physical world and user behavior analysis, and ii) seamless rendering in presence of the DNN execution for immersive user experience. Existing mobile deep learning frameworks, however, fail to support such workload: multi-DNN GPU contention slows down inference latency (e.g., from 59.93 to 1181 ms), and rendering-DNN GPU contention degrades frame rate (e.g., from 30 to \u224812 fps). Multi-tasking for desktop GPUs (e.g., parallelization, preemption) cannot be applied to mobile GPUs as well due to limited architectural support and memory bandwidth. To tackle the challenge, we design a Pseudo-Preemption mechanism which i) breaks down the bulky DNN into smaller units, and ii) prioritizes and flexibly schedules concurrent GPU tasks. We prototyped Heimdall over various mobile GPUs (i.e., recent Adreno series) and multiple AR app scenarios that involve combinations of 8 state-of-the-art DNNs. Our extensive evaluation shows that Heimdall enhances the frame rate from \u224812 to \u224830 fps while reducing the worst-case DNN inference latency by up to \u224815 times compared to the baseline multi-threading approach.",

                    "abstract": "Deployment of billions of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) RFID tags has drawn much of the attention of the research community because of the performance gaps of current systems. In particular, hash-enabled protocol (HEP) is one of the most thoroughly studied topics in the past decade. HEPs are designed for a wide spectrum of notable applications (e.g., missing detection) without need to collect all tags. HEPs assume that each tag contains a hash function, such that a tag can select a random but predicable time slot to reply with a one-bit presence signal that shows its existence. However, the hash function has never been implemented in COTS tags in reality, which makes HEPs a 10-year untouchable mirage. This work designs and implements a group of analog on-tag hash primitives (called Tash) for COTS Gen2-compatible RFID systems, which moves prior HEPs forward from theory to practice. In particular, we design three types of hash primitives, namely, tash function, tash table function and tash operator. All of these hash primitives are implemented through selective reading, which is a fundamental and mandatory functionality specified in Gen2 protocol, without any hardware modification and fabrication. We further apply our hash primitives in two typical HEP applications (i.e., cardinality estimation and missing detection) to show the feasibility and effectiveness of Tash. Results from our prototype, which is composed of one ImpinJ reader and 3,000 Alien tags, demonstrate that the new design lowers 60% of the communication overhead in the air. The tash operator can additionally introduce an overhead drop of 29.7%.",

                    "abstract": "Programmable switches have been touted as an attractive alternative for deploying network functions (NFs) such as network address translators (NATs), load balancers, and firewalls. However, their limited memory capacity has been a major stumbling block that has stymied their adoption for supporting state-intensive NFs such as cloud-scale NATs and load balancers that maintain millions of flow-table entries. In this paper, we explore a new approach that leverages DRAM on servers available in typical NFV clusters. Our new system architecture, called TEA (Table Extension Architecture), provides a virtual table abstraction that allows NFs on programmable switches to look up large virtual tables built on external DRAM. Our approach enables switch ASICs to access external DRAM purely in the data plane without involving CPUs on servers. We address key design and implementation challenges in realizing this idea. We demonstrate its feasibility and practicality with our implementation on a Tofino-based programmable switch. Our evaluation shows that NFs built with TEA can look up table entries on external DRAM with low and predictable latency (1.8-2.2 \u03bcs) and the lookup throughput can be linearly scaled with additional servers (138 million lookups per seconds with 8 servers).",

                    "abstract": "WiFi location systems are remarkably accurate, with decimeter-level errors for recent CSI-based systems. However, such high accuracy is achieved under Line-of-Sight (LOS) conditions and with an access point (AP) density that is much higher than that typically found in current deployments that primarily target good coverage. In contrast, when many of the APs within range are in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS), the location accuracy degrades drastically.In this paper we present UbiLocate, a WiFi location system that copes well with common AP deployment densities and works ubiquitously, i.e., without excessive degradation under NLOS. UbiLocate demonstrates that meter-level median accuracy NLOS localization is possible through (i) an innovative angle estimator based on a Nelder-Mead search, (ii) a fine-grained time of flight ranging system with nanosecond resolution, and (iii) the accuracy improvements brought about by the increase in bandwidth and number of antennas of IEEE 802.11ac. In combination, they provide superior resolvability of multipath components, significantly improving location accuracy over prior work. We implement our location system on off-the-shelf 802.11ac devices and make the implementation, CSI-extraction tool and custom Fine Timing Measurement design publicly available to the research community. We carry out an extensive performance analysis of our system and show that it outperforms current state-of-the-art location systems by a factor of 2--3, both under LOS and NLOS.",

BurstTracker is driven by our discovery that the proprietary LTE downlink schedulers running on LTE base stations allocate resources to users in a way that reveals if a user's downlink queue runs empty during a download. We demonstrate that BurstTracker works across Tier-1 cellular providers and across a variety of network conditions. We also present a case study that shows how application developers can use this tool in practice. Surprisingly, with BurstTracker, we find that the LTE downlink may not be the bottleneck for video streaming on several Tier-1 providers, even during peak hours at busy locations. Rather, transparent TCP middleboxes deployed by these providers lead to downlink underutilization, because they force Slow-Start Restart. With a simple workaround, we improve video streaming bitrate on busy LTE links by 35%.",

In this paper, we aim to explore the molecular communication channel through theoretical and empirical modeling in order to achieve a better understanding of its characteristics, which tend to be more complex in practice than traditional wireless and wired channels. Our study reveals two key new characteristics that have been overlooked by past work. Specifically, the molecular communication channel exhibits non-causal inter-symbol-interference and a long delay spread, that extends beyond the channel coherence time, which limit decoding performance. To address this, we design, \u03bc-Link a molecular communication protocol and decoder that accounts for these new insights. We build a testbed to experimentally validate our findings and show that \u03bc-Link can improve the achievable data rates with significantly lower bit error rates.",

Such capabilities can be enabled with deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), but it remains difficult to execute large networks on mobile devices. Offloading object detection to the edge or cloud is also very challenging due to the stringent requirements on high detection accuracy and low end-to-end latency. The long latency of existing offloading techniques can significantly reduce the detection accuracy due to changes in the user's view. To address the problem, we design a system that enables high accuracy object detection for commodity AR/MR system running at 60fps. The system employs low latency offloading techniques, decouples the rendering pipeline from the offloading pipeline, and uses a fast object tracking method to maintain detection accuracy. The result shows that the system can improve the detection accuracy by 20.2%-34.8% for the object detection and human keypoint detection tasks, and only requires 2.24ms latency for object tracking on the AR device. Thus, the system leaves more time and computational resources to render virtual elements for the next frame and enables higher quality AR/MR experiences.",

However, applications with integrated control are inherently hard to write in existing data-plane programming languages such as P4. This paper presents Lucid, a language that raises the level of abstraction for putting control functionality in the data plane. Lucid introduces abstractions that make it easy to write sophisticated data-plane applications with interleaved packet-handling and control logic, specialized type and syntax systems that prevent programmer bugs related to data-plane state, and an open-sourced compiler that translates Lucid programs into P4 optimized for the Intel Tofino. These features make Lucid general and easy to use, as we demonstrate by writing a suite of ten different data-plane applications in Lucid. Working prototypes take well under an hour to write, even for a programmer without prior Tofino experience, have around 10x fewer lines of code compared to P4, and compile efficiently to real hardware. In a stateful firewall written in Lucid, we find that moving control from a switch's CPU to its data-plane processor using Lucid reduces the latency of performance-sensitive operations by over 300X.",

Existing location forecasting techniques are driven by large volumes of data to train the prediction models in a centralised server. This amounts to considerably long waiting times before the model kicks in. Disclosing highly sensitive location information to third party entities also exposes the user to several privacy risks. To address these issues, we put forth a mobility prediction system, able to provide swift realtime predictions, evading the strenuous training procedure. We enable this by constantly adapting the model to substantive user mobility behaviours that facilitate accurate predictions even on marginal time bounded movements. In comparison to existing frameworks, we utilise less volumes of data to produce satisfactory prediction accuracies. This in turn lowers the computational complexity making implementation on mobile devices feasible and a step towards privacy preservation. Here, only the predicted location can be sent to such services to maintain the utility/privacy tradeoff. Our preliminary evaluations based on real world mobility traces corroborate our hypothesis.",

Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that U2B can achieve throughputs up to 20 kbps, an operational range up to 62 m, and can scale to networks with more than 10 nodes. In comparison to the state-of-the-art system for underwater backscatter, our design achieves 5x more throughput and 6x more communication range. Moreover, our evaluation represents the first experimental validation of underwater backscatter in the wild.",

In order to address these problems, the concept of \"smart parking\" is put forward. To make a parking lot \"smart\", we argue that three basic features, namely Vehicle Identification, Parking Space Detection and Indoor Localization are are critical and should be supported by the infrastructure. Herein, we present LightPark, a Visible Light Communication (VLC) solution to realize the vision of \"smart parking\". Building on top of the visible light backscatter communication primitive, LightPark is able to leverage the lighting infrastructure to perform scalable visible light communication and networking with the batter-free tag devices instrumented on the vehicles and parking spaces to manage the critical information such as identification and real-time location of vehicles, and status of parking spaces in a centralized and low-cost manner.",

With most of these transmitters in communication range, this represents an extremely dense wireless configuration that challenges radio and interference models. Field test and simulations were conducted in tandem and iteratively to facilitate model selection and configuration as well as to allow a detailed evaluation of simulation accuracy. We have learned that 1) results were most sensitive to parameter choices in the propagation and receiver models, with simulator default parameters not providing a good match; 2) results could, however, be significantly improved by adapting, implementing, and calibrating the propagation models and receiver models from the literature, yielding 88% accuracy (in terms of packet error rate compared to the field test) in such a complex large-scale setting; 3) the process was helpful in identifying errors both in the simulation models and in the experimental code and points to opportunities for further research.",

In this work, we present an RFID-based solution, Tagbeat, to inspect mechanical vibration using COTS RFID tags and readers. Making sense of micro and high-frequency vibration using random and low-frequency readings of tag has been a daunting task, especially challenging for achieving sub-millisecond period accuracy. Our system achieves these three goals by discerning the change pattern of backscatter signal replied from the tag, which is attached on the vibrating surface and displaced by the vibration within a small range. This work introduces three main innovations. First, it shows how one can utilize COTS RFID to sense mechanical vibration and accurately discover its period with a few periods of short and noisy samples. Second, a new digital microscope is designed to amplify the micro-vibration-induced weak signals. Third, Tagbeat introduces compressive reading to inspect high-frequency vibration with relatively low RFID read rate. We implement Tagbeat using a COTS RFID device and evaluate it with a commercial centrifugal machine. Empirical benchmarks with a prototype show that Tagbeat can inspect the vibration period with a mean accuracy of 0.36ms and a relative error rate of 0.03%. We also study three cases to demonstrate how to associate our inspection solution with the specific domain requirements.",

However, a mobile GPU constitutes a major portion of power consumption on the devices, and mobile games top as the most popular class of graphics applications. This paper presents the design and implementation of RAVEN, a novel, on-the-fly frame rate scaling system for mobile gaming applications. RAVEN utilizes human visual perception of graphics change to opportunistically achieve power saving without degrading user experiences. The system develops a light-weight frame comparison technique to measure and predict perception-aware frame similarity. It also builds a low resolution virtual display which clones the device screen for performing similarity measurement at a low-power cost. It is able to work on an existing commercial smartphone and support applications from app stores without any modifications. It has been implemented on Nexus 5X, and its performance has been measured with 13 games. The system effectively reduces the overall power consumption of mobile devices while maintaining satisfactory user experiences. The power consumption is reduced by 21.78% on aver-age and up to 34.74%.",

                    "abstract": "In recent years, considerable effort has been recently exerted to explore the high-precision RF-tracking systems indoors to satisfy various real-world demands. However, such systems are tailored for a particular type of device (e.g., RFID, WSN or Wi-Fi). With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), various new wireless protocols (e.g., LoRa, Sigfox, and NB-IoT) have been proposed to accommodate different demands. The coexistence of multiple types of IoT devices forces users to deploy multiple tracking systems in a warehouse or a smart home where various IoT devices are running, which causes huge additional costs in installation and maintenance. To address this issue, this work presents iArk, which is a general-purpose tracking platform for all types of IoT devices working at the ultra high frequency band. Our innovation lies in the design of the \"K+1\"-model hardware, the protocol free middleware, and the multipath resistant learnware. By the virtue of decoupling from wireless protocols, iArk also allows researchers to concentrate on developing a new tracking algorithm without considering the protocol diversity. To date, the platform can support five mainstream types of IoT devices (i.e., NB-IoT, LoRa, RFID, Sigfox and Zigbee) and is scalable to other types with minimal effort.",

We investigate the downlink throughput of Wi-Fi systems with commercially available 802.11ac products in multiple indoor environments to reveal the throughput of MU-MIMO system that user experiences in practice. From our experiments, Single-User MIMO (SU-MIMO) outperformed MU-MIMO at every experimental environments. We further provide analysis on our experimental results considering channel sounding overhead, user grouping, environmental impact, and transmission mode selection.",

Aquila addresses four challenges in building a practically usable verification: (1) specification complexity; (2) verification scalability; (3) bug localization; and (4) verifier self validation. Specifically, first, Aquila proposes a high-level language that facilitates easy expression of specifications, reducing lines of specification codes by tenfold compared to the state-of-the-art. Second, Aquila constructs a sequential encoding algorithm to circumvent the exponential growth of states associated with the upscaling of data plane programs to production level. Third, Aquila adopts an automatic and accurate bug localization approach that can narrow down suspects based on reported violations and pinpoint the culprit by simulating a fix for each suspect. Fourth and finally, Aquila can perform self validation based on refinement proof, which involves the construction of an alternative representation and subsequent equivalence checking. To this date, Aquila has been used in the verification of our production-scale programmable edge networks for over half a year, and it has successfully prevented many potential failures resulting from data plane bugs.",

A machine-type communication system is adopted for the delivery of ECG data to benefit from its inherent reliability, pervasiveness, security, and performance of 4G long-term evolution technologies with reduced cost and enhanced coverage. Extensive evaluations indicate that the proposed system provides a sufficient level of service for medical-grade instantaneous ECG monitoring even under significantly deteriorated channel conditions.",

Our design, called SiP-ML, accelerates the training time of popular DNN models using silicon photonics links capable of providing multiple terabits-per-second of bandwidth per GPU. SiP-ML partitions the training job across GPUs with hybrid data and model parallelism while ensuring the communication pattern can be supported efficiently on the network interconnect. We develop task partitioning and device placement methods that take the degree and reconfiguration latency of optical interconnects into account. Simulations using real DNN models show that, compared to the state-of-the-art electrical networks, our approach improves training time by 1.3--9.1x.",

                    "abstract": "Increasing numbers of everyday objects in libraries, stores and warehouses are instrumented with passive RFID tags, resulting in a ripe opportunity for gesture-based interactions with people. By a simple act of picking up and gesturing with an RFID-tagged object, users can send their opinions and sentiments about that object to the cloud. Prior work in RFID-based gesture tracking relies on multiple bulky and expensive antennas and readers to function, which incurs unacceptable infrastructure costs for large-scale ubiquitous deployment (over an entire warehouse or mall, for example) thus hindering practical adoption. In this paper, we propose Pantomime, the first RFID-based gesture recognition system that uses just a single antenna per geographical area of coverage. Our key insight is to replace the conventional multiple antenna single tag tracking framework with an equivalent multiple tag single antenna system. Through a novel tag coordination protocol and a lightweight tracking algorithm, Pantomime enables accurate gesture tracking that works for objects tagged with just two RFID tags. We implement a real-time prototype of Pantomime with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) RFID readers and antennas. Extensive evaluations and real-world case studies in a classroom and a retail store demonstrate that Pantomime achieves comparable gesture tracking accuracy (87%) to state-of-the-art multi-antenna schemes (88%) at a minimal deployment cost.",

When users keep accessing the system, the traffic in 5G core network (5GC) may be congested. Thus, we propose a load balance algorithm to select the best traffic data routing path based on the traffic loading in the 5GC. The proposed algorithm is implemented in a 5G testbed called free5GC. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional round-robin load balance algorithm in many performance metrics.",

Compared to existing state-of-the-art, Freedom does not rely on any video frame pre- rendering or viewpoint prediction. We send a latency-adaptive VAM frame that contains pixels around the FoV. This allows the clients to render locally at a high refresh rate of 60 Hz to accommodate and compensate for the user's head movements before the next server update arrives. We demonstrate that Freedom is the first system in the world that can support dynamic and live 8K resolution VR content, while adapting to the real-world latency variations experienced in cellular networks. Compared to streaming the whole 360\u00b0 panoramic VR content, we show that Freedom achieves up to 80% bandwidth savings. Finally, we provide detailed end to end latency measurements of actual VR systems by running extensive experiments in a private LTE testbed using a Mobile Edge Cloud (MEC).",

While Neural Networks (NNs)-based object detection models have shown excellent accuracy on benchmark datasets, they are not well positioned for high-resolution images inference on resource-constrained edge devices. Common approaches, including down-sampling inputs and scaling up neural networks, fall short of adapting to video content changes and various latency requirements. This paper presents Remix, a flexible framework for high-resolution object detection on edge devices. Remix takes as input a latency budget, and come up with an image partition and model execution plan which runs off-the-shelf neural networks on non-uniformly partitioned image blocks. As a result, it maximizes the overall detection accuracy by allocating various amount of compute power onto different areas of an image. We evaluate Remix on public dataset as well as real-world videos collected by ourselves. Experimental results show that Remix can either improve the detection accuracy by 18%-120% for a given latency budget, or achieve up to 8.1\\texttimes{} inference speedup with accuracy on par with the state-of-the-art NNs.",

Backscatter tags achieve this by the reflection or absorption of carrier signal generated from emitter devices. However, backscatter systems are limited by these emitter devices, as they are significantly energy-expensive when compared to the tags. While backscatter tags can operate without requiring batteries, relying on the minuscule amounts of energy harvested from the ambient environment. However, the emitter devices, are commonly tethered to an external power supply or operate on large batteries.We present Tunnel Emitter: a tunnel diode oscillator based system that enables the generation of carrier signals at a peak biasing power of tens of \u03bcW. Thus, for the first time, it allows battery-free emitter devices. The key enabler to the design is a phenomenon exhibited by tunnel diode oscillators that we call back injection, and we are the first to demonstrate. Back injection enables the emitter devices to amplify (up to 20 dB) and relay the backscattered signal. Our results show that Tunnel Emitter when operating together with a tag from long-range backscatter system, facilitates multi-floor communication. Tunnel Emitter, due to the back injection phenomenon, achieves this with a carrier signal that is orders of magnitude weaker than used in state-of-the-art systems. We believe Tunnel Emitter overcomes the key constraint restricting backscatter systems and thus can make backscatter systems ubiquitous.",

Three key goals on imperceptible, high rate, and reliable communication are desirable but conflicting, and existing solutions usually made a trade-off among them. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of ChromaCode, a screen-camera communication system that achieves all three goals simultaneously. In our design, we consider for the first time color space for perceptually uniform lightness modifications. On this basis, we design an outcome-based adaptive embedding scheme, which adapts to both pixel lightness and regional texture. Last, we propose a concatenated code scheme for robust coding and devise multiple techniques to overcome various screen-camera channel errors. Our prototype and experiments demonstrate that ChromaCode achieves remarkable raw throughputs of &gt;700 kbps, data goodputs of 120 kbps with BER of 0.05, and with fully imperceptible flicker for viewing proved by user study, which significantly outperforms previous works.",

Differently from traditional generators, whose goal is creating packet flows which emulate specific applications and protocols, our focus is generating a combined radio signal, as seen by a gateway, given by the super-position of the signals transmitted by multiple sensors simultaneously active on the same channel. We argue that such a generator can be of interest for testing different network planning solutions for LoRa networks.",

While space launch costs have lowered significantly with innovative launch vehicles, private players, and smaller payloads, access to ground infrastructure remains a luxury. This is especially true for smaller LEO satellites that are only visible at any location for a few tens of minutes a day and whose signals are extremely weak, necessitating bulky and expensive ground station infrastructure.In this paper, we present a community-driven distributed reception paradigm for LEO satellite signals where signals received on many tiny handheld receivers (not necessarily deployed on rooftops but also indoors) are coherently combined to recover the desired signal. This is made possible by employing new synchronization and receiver orientation techniques that study satellite trajectories and leverage the presence of other ambient signals. We compare our results with a large commercial receiver deployed on a rooftop and show a 8 dB SNR increase both indoors and outdoors using 8 receivers, costing $38 per RF frontend.",

The core idea lies in exploiting nonlinearities in microphone hardware with a combination of ultrasound frequencies. These frequencies can be regulated to carry data bits, thereby enabling an acoustic (but inaudible) communication channel to today's microphones. Other applications include jamming spy microphones in the environment, live watermarking of music in a concert, and even acoustic Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.",

Many studies have found that the primary factors responsible for road accidents center on the driver and her/his driving. Hence, there is the need to monitor driver's state and her/his driving, with a view to providing effective feedback. Our proposed demo is of HAMS, a windshield-mounted, smartphone-based system that uses the front camera to monitor the driver and back camera to monitor her/his driving behaviour. The objective of HAMS is to provide ADAS-like functionality with low-cost devices that can be retrofitted onto the large installed base of vehicles that lack specialized and expensive sensors such as LIDAR and RADAR. Our demo would show HAMS in action on an Android smartphone to monitor the state of the driver, specifically such as drowsiness, distraction and gaze, and vehicle ranging, lane detection running on pre-recorded videos from drives.",

Properly routing incidents is challenging because of the complexity of today's data center (DC) applications and their dependencies. For instance, an application running on a VM might rely on a functioning host-server, remote-storage service, and virtual and physical network components. It is hard for any one team, rule-based system, or even machine learning solution to fully learn the complexity and solve the incident routing problem. We propose a different approach using per-team Scouts. Each teams' Scout acts as its gate-keeper --- it routes relevant incidents to the team and routes-away unrelated ones. We solve the problem through a collection of these Scouts. Our PhyNet Scout alone --- currently deployed in production --- reduces the time-to-mitigation of 65% of mis-routed incidents in our dataset.",

Tiny-Yolo, which is a kind of Convolutional Neural Network, was used as recognition technology. Camera sensors were installed on ceilings in various places inside the building to collect training data for human detection.

The key challenge in doing so stems from the impracticality of embedding electronics in the tip of such instruments (a pen, marker, scalpel, etc.) as well as the difficulties in instrumenting the surface that it works on. In this paper, we present ITrackU, a movement digitization system that does not require modifications to the surface or the tracked instrument's tip. ITrackU fuses locations obtained using ultra-wideband radios (UWB), with an inertial and magnetic unit (IMU) and a pressure sensor, yielding multidimensional improvements in accuracy, range, cost, and robustness, over existing works. ITrackU embeds a micro-transmitter at the base of a pen which creates a trackable beacon, that is localized from the corners of a writing surface. Fused with inertial motion sensor and a pressure sensor, ITrackU enables accurate tracking. Our prototype of ITrackU covers a large 2.5m \\texttimes{} 2m area, while obtaining around 2.9mm median error. We demonstrate the accuracy of our system by drawing numerous shapes and characters on a whiteboard, and compare them against a touchscreen and a camera-based ground-truthing system. Finally, the produced stream of digitized data is minuscule in volume, when compared with a video of the whiteboard, which saves both network bandwidth and storage space.",

Running an object detection engine (i.e., deep learning models such as YOLO and EfficientDet) for each frame makes video analytics pipelines difficult to achieve real-time processing. In this paper, we leverage selective processing of frames and batching of frames to reduce the overall cost of running detection models on live videos. We discuss several factors that hinder the real-time processing of detection-driven video analytics. We propose a system with configurable knobs and show how to achieve the stability of the system using a Lyapunov-based control strategy. In our setup, heterogeneous edge devices (e.g. mobile phones, cameras) stream videos to a low-resource edge server where frames are selectively processed in batches and the detection results are sent to the cloud or to the edge device for further application-aware processing. Preliminary results on controlling different knobs, such as frame skipping, frame size, and batch size show interesting insights to achieve real-time processing of multi-stream video streams with low overhead and low overall information loss.",

Do CPs that update their CDN contracts to allow IPv6 hosting achieve better, or worse performance in mobile networks? Should CDNs continue to host mobile content over IPv4 networks, or persuade to their CP customers the performance benefits of IPv6 content delivery?In this paper we answer these questions through a comprehensive comparison of IPv4 and IPv6 mobile Web performance in cellular networks in the US from the point of view of Akamai's content delivery infrastructure. Our data show that IPv6 hosting outperforms legacy IPv4 paths in mobile Web. Our analysis leads to clear recommendations for CPs to transition to IPv6-hosted mobile Web. Finally, we propose new mechanisms, through which CDNs can safely transition mobile content to IPv6-enabled servers for improved content delivery.",

And recently there has been a large shift from handheld-controller dominated interactions to headset-dominated interactions via voice interfaces. In this work, we show a serious privacy risk of using voice interfaces while the user is wearing the face-mounted AR/VR devices. Specifically, we design an eavesdropping attack, Face-Mic, which leverages speech-associated subtle facial dynamics captured by zero-permission motion sensors in AR/VR headsets to infer highly sensitive information from live human speech, including speaker gender, identity, and speech content. Face-Mic is grounded on a key insight that AR/VR headsets are closely mounted on the user's face, allowing a potentially malicious app on the headset to capture underlying facial dynamics as the wearer speaks, including movements of facial muscles and bone-borne vibrations, which encode private biometrics and speech characteristics. To mitigate the impacts of body movements, we develop a signal source separation technique to identify and separate the speech-associated facial dynamics from other types of body movements. We further extract representative features with respect to the two types of facial dynamics. We successfully demonstrate the privacy leakage through AR/VR headsets by deriving the user's gender/identity and extracting speech information via the development of a deep learning-based framework.

                    "abstract": "With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), establishing a secure channel between smart devices becomes crucial. Recent research proposes zero-interaction pairing (ZIP), which enables pairing without user assistance by utilizing devices' physical context (e.g., ambient audio) to obtain a shared secret key. The state-of-the-art ZIP schemes suffer from three limitations: (1) prolonged pairing time (i.e., minutes or hours), (2) vulnerability to brute-force offline attacks on a shared key, and (3) susceptibility to attacks caused by predictable context (e.g., replay attack) because they rely on limited entropy of physical context to protect a shared key. We address these limitations, proposing FastZIP, a novel ZIP scheme that significantly reduces pairing time while preventing offline and predictable context attacks. In particular, we adapt a recently introduced Fuzzy Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (fPAKE) protocol and utilize sensor fusion, maximizing their advantages. We instantiate FastZIP for intra-car device pairing to demonstrate its feasibility and show how the design of FastZIP can be adapted to other ZIP use cases. We implement FastZIP and evaluate it by driving four cars for a total of 800 km. We achieve up to three times shorter pairing time compared to the state-of-the-art ZIP schemes while assuring robust security with adversarial error rates below 0.5%.",

However, including such information on packets adds significant overhead that impacts both flow completion times and application-level performance.We introduce PINT, an in-band network telemetry framework that bounds the amount of information added to each packet. PINT encodes the requested data on multiple packets, allowing per-packet overhead limits that can be as low as one bit. We analyze PINT and prove performance bounds, including cases when multiple queries are running simultaneously. PINT is implemented in P4 and can be deployed on network devices.Using real topologies and traffic characteristics, we show that PINT concurrently enables applications such as congestion control, path tracing, and computing tail latencies, using only sixteen bits per packet, with performance comparable to the state of the art.",

The IoT vision for ubiquitous interconnection, in practice, demands multi-hop connectivity for robust and scalable sensor networks, as well as compatibility with such prevailing wireless technologies as WiFi. Today's backscatter solutions however typically follow a single-hop paradigm, i.e., tags do not relay for each other. This paper presents X-Tandem, a multi-hop backscatter system that works with commodity WiFi devices. For the first time, we demonstrate that sensing tags can not only work as relays for each other but also modulate their sensing data into a single backscatter packet, which remains a legit WiFi packet that can be decoded with any commercial WiFi NICs. We discuss the design details of X-Tandem and have built a prototype with FPGAs and off-the-shelf WiFi devices. The prototype demonstrates a two-hop implementation, achieving a throughput up to 200 bps with tag-to-tag distances up to 0.4 m and communication ranges up to 8 m. Compared to single-hop solutions, X-Tandem can improve backscatter throughput by more than 10x in challenging indoor environments with obstacles.",

Such devices thus become our information portal, e.g., SMS message and notifications are delivered to those devices through BLE. In this study, we present BlueDoor, which can obtain unauthorized information from smart devices via BLE vulnerability. We thoroughly examine the BLE protocol, and leverage its intrinsic properties designed for low-cost embedded and wearable devices to bypass the encryption and authentication in BLE. By mimicking a low capacity device to downgrade the process of encryption key negotiation and authentication, BlueDoor can enforce a new key with the peripheral BLE device and pass the authentication without user participation. As a result, BlueDoor can extract BLE packets as well as read/write stored data on BLE devices. We show that BlueDoor works well on the fundamental design tradeoff of using BLE on diverse embedded and wearable devices, and thus can be generalized to various BLE devices. We implement the BlueDoor design and examine its performance on 15 COTS BLE enabled smart devices, including fitness trackers, smartwatch, smart bulb, etc. The results show that BlueDoor can break the information flow and obtain different types of information (e.g., SMS message, notifications) delivered to BLE devices. In addition to privacy threats, this further means traditional operations such as using SMS for verification in widely adopted authentication, are insecure.",

Prior work has used two different metrics, bisection bandwidth and throughput, for evaluating these topologies at scale. Little is known, theoretically or practically, how these metrics relate to each other. Exploiting characteristics of these topologies, we prove an upper bound on their throughput, then show that this upper bound better estimates worst-case throughput than all previously proposed throughput estimators and scales better than most of them. Using this upper bound, we show that for expander-based topologies, unlike Clos, beyond a certain size of the network, no topology can have full throughput, even if it has full bisection bandwidth; in fact, even relatively small expander-based topologies fail to achieve full throughput. We conclude by showing that using throughput to evaluate datacenter performance instead of bisection bandwidth can alter conclusions in prior work about datacenter cost, manageability, and reliability.",

However, due to traffic dynamics in the high-speed production networks, it is difficult to maintain persistent performance by using the static ECN setting. To meet the operational challenge, in this paper we report the design and implementation of an automatic run-time optimization scheme, ACC, which leverages the multi-agent reinforcement learning technique to dynamically adjust the marking threshold at each switch. The proposed approach works in a distributed fashion and combines offline and online training to adapt to dynamic traffic patterns. It can be easily deployed based on the common features supported by major commodity switching chips. Both testbed experiments and large-scale simulations have shown that ACC achieves low flow completion time (FCT) for both mice flows and elephant flows at line-rate. Under heterogeneous production environments with 300 machines, compared with the well-tuned static ECN settings, ACC achieves up to 20% improvement on IOPS and 30% lower FCT for storage service. ACC has been applied in high-speed datacenter networks and significantly simplifies the network operations.",

CA performance prediction (CAPP) metrics are novel tools that address the problem of appropriate CA selection. However, most CAPP metrics depend upon a variety of factors such as the WMN topology, the type of CA scheme, and connectedness of the underlying graph. In this work, we propose an improved Channel Assignment Link-Weight Metric (iCALM) that is independent of these constraints. To the best of our knowledge, iCALM is the first universal CAPP metric for WMNs. To evaluate iCALM, we design two WMN topologies that conform to the attributes of real-world mesh network deployments, and run rigorous simulations in ns-3. We compare iCALM to four existing CAPP metrics, and demonstrate that it performs exceedingly well, regardless of the CA type, and the WMN layout.",

The current state of the art for wearable devices is for a developer to write a custom {em companion app}, which is a variant of the smartphone app, tailored to the wearable form factor. A developer puts a non-trivial amount of effort to write these companion apps and the programming model does not scale to an increasing diversity of form factors. In this demo, we show a working prototype of our system UIWear that allows a developer to easily extend a smartphone application to other wearable interfaces. Our system, UIWear, extracts the application GUI as a UI tree, which preserves the semantics of the GUI. The developer (or the user) only writes a {em metaprogram} to encode the GUI design for the wearable device; no effort is needed beyond the design phase. UIWear executes the metaprogram by performing all the underlying tasks to virtualize the application GUI, adapt it, and recreate it on the wearable. A metaprogram can create the same functionality as existing companion apps with an order-of-magnitude less programming effort.",

However, the fundamental requirement of visible light communications, flicker-free illumination, becomes a key limitation hindering existing technologies from serving a camera at larger distances. To break this limitation, this paper presents POLI, a light-to-camera communication system that exploits a novel POlarized Light Intensity modulation scheme to provide reliable communications for a wide range of distances. The key idea of POLI is to hide the information with the polarization direction of the light, to which human eyes are insensitive. Taking advantage of this, POLI can change the intensity of the polarized light as slowly as possible, at a rate determined by the range the system would support, but does not generate flickers. By using an optical component to \"transform polarization directions to colors\", POLI allows a camera to leverage its received RGB values as the three spatial dimensions to recover the information carried in different data streams. POLI further incorporates a number of designs to tackle the non-linearity effect of a camera, which is especially critical for an intensity-based modulation scheme. We implemented a prototype using the USRP N200 combined with off-the-shelf optical components. The experimental results show that POLI delivers to its camera receiver a throughput proportional to the dynamic channel conditions. The achievable throughput can be up to 71 bytes per second at short distances, while the service range can be up to 40 meters.",

Conventionally, the radios and processors used in these end devices are major power consumption that drains at the level of milliwatts (mWs). However, in recent decades, backscatter communication has dramatically reduced the power consumed by the radios in end devices to microwatts (\u03bcWs), and thus the processor remains the major bottleneck for energy optimization.In this paper, we propose a processor-free architecture as a novel design that allows the radio to interface directly with peripheral sensor chips for control and data collection, thereby separating the processors from the end device design to significantly reduce the energy consumed by end devices. The main problem is that the peripheral chips are designed to be accessed by the processor via a standard digital bus and they cannot communicate directly with the radio. In order to support such processor-free design, we propose radio-to-bus (R2B) as a novel communication paradigm that allows direct data exchange between a backscatter radio and the serial peripheral interface (SPI) bus. We implement the processor-free architecture in proof-of-concept prototypes and demonstrate that the power consumption decreases by 4.5 times compared with the conventional end device design.",

However, Bluetooth specification 5 released in 2016 specifies 2 Mb/s and coded PHY for higher throughput and for more stable transmission, respectively. In addition, this version of specification defines transmission power from -20 dBm to 20 dBm. In this paper, we propose AdaptaBLE, an algorithm that selects the data rate and transmission power of BLE by considering link stability and energy consumption. We implement AdaptaBLE on real devices and measure its performance. As a result, we confirm that AdaptaBLE successfully lowers energy consumption while keeping the link stable.",

However, the heterogeneous structure of the in-vehicle network and lack of security consideration has introduced a lack of scalability and security concerns. In this work, we propose a shuffling-based moving target defense (MTD) technique aiming to disturb network reconnaissance attacks and deployed it in the proposed software-defined networking (SDN)-based in-vehicle network architecture. To validate the proposed MTD, we compare the service availability of our proposed MTD and non-MTD counterpart in the presence of the reconnaissance-based false message injection attacks.",

Unfortunately, existing strategies to alleviate the network latencies that hinder app responsiveness fall short in practice. In particular, caching is plagued by challenges in setting expiration times that match when a resource's content changes, while prefetching hinges on accurate predictions of user behavior that have proven elusive. We present Marauder, a system that synergizes caching and prefetching to improve the speedups achieved by each technique while avoiding their inherent limitations. Key to Marauder is our observation that, like web pages, apps handle interactions by downloading and parsing structured text resources that entirely list (i.e., without needing to consult app binaries) the set of other resources to load. Building on this, Marauder introduces two low-risk optimizations directly from the app's cache. First, guided by cached text files, Marauder prefetches referenced resources during an already-triggered interaction. Second, to improve the efficacy of cached content, Marauder judiciously prefetches about-to-expire resources, extending cache lives for unchanged resources, and downloading updates for lightweight (but crucial) text files. Across a wide range of apps, live networks, interaction traces, and phones, Marauder reduces median and 90th percentile interaction response times by 27.4% and 43.5%, while increasing data usage by only 18%.",

We present SDC (software-defined cooking), a low-cost closed-loop microwave oven system that aims to heat the food in a software-defined thermal trajectory. SDC achieves this through a novel high-resolution heat sensing and actuation system that uses microwave-safe components to augment existing microwaves. SDC first senses thermal gradient by using arrays of neon lamps that are charged by the Electromagnetic (EM) field a microwave produces. SDC then modifies the EM-field strength to desired levels by accurately moving food on a programmable turntable towards sensed hot and cold spots. To create a more skewed arbitrary thermal pattern, SDC further introduces two types of programmable accessories: microwave shield and susceptor. We design and implement one experimental test-bed by modifying a commercial off-the-shelf microwave oven. Our evaluation shows that SDC can programmatically create temperature deltas at a resolution of 21 degrees with a spatial resolution of 3 cm without accessories and 183 degrees with the help of accessories. We further demonstrate how a SDC-enabled microwave can be enlisted to perform unexpected cooking tasks: cooking meat and fat in bacon discriminatively and heating milk uniformly.",

The corresponding technique has gradually evolved from the classification of multiple activity types to more fine-grained tracking of 3D human poses. However, existing WiFi-based 3D human pose tracking is limited to a set of predefined activities. In this work, we present Winect, a 3D human pose tracking system for free-form activity using commodity WiFi devices. Our system tracks free-form activity by estimating a 3D skeleton pose that consists of a set of joints of the human body. In particular, Winect first identifies the moving limbs by leveraging the signals reflected off the human body and separates the entangled signals for each limb. Then, our system tracks each limb and constructs a 3D skeleton of the body by modeling the inherent relationship between the movements of the limb and the corresponding joints. Our evaluation results show that Winect achieves centimeter-level accuracy for free-form activity tracking under various environments.",

                    "abstract": "While GPS (Global Positioning System) navigation and GPS based autonomous car driving techniques are mature, the security of GPS signal has not been a primary system concern. In fact, it has been shown that an ordinary GPS can be easily spoofed by a low-cost, open-source based software defined radio (SDR) system such as bladeRF and HackRF [3, 4] which can cause serious complications to the navigation system of the car especially for self-driving cars which are driven based on the information from sensors, cameras, and GPS. In this work, we design a new GPS authentication system called lightweight authentication GPS (AuthGPS) to authenticate GPS signal against GPS spoofing and LTE base station broadcast message spoofing. In the past, there have been many successful attempts on GPS spoofing which resulted in shifting the destination of the car to the spoofer's desired location. In a case where the car is connected to the Internet via LTE network, the navigation system can find out if the GPS is spoofed by acquiring the correct GPS satellite information from LTE base stations' location information. However, a skillful attacker can spoof the LTE base station signals [7] as well using another SDR which will produce spoofed LTE base station information. Hence giving wrong information about GPSinformation according to the will of the attacker. Currently, there are defense methods against the GPS spoofing [6]. One of them is signal-processing-based methods. By monitoring unusual or unreasonable signal changes at GPS receivers, GPS spoofing attack can be detected. Received Power Monitoring (RPM) looks at all the received amplitude and automatic gain control (AGC) setpoint [1]. The receiver will sense drastic power jump if a spoofing attack occurs. However, an overly powerful spoofing attack with noise is not detectable in the case of this mechanism. Another way to detect spoofing is the symmetric-key encryption mechanism of GPS signals. According to previous research [2], encrypted precision code for anti-spoofing referred to as P(Y) code, might not be able to be spoofed. A spoofing attack can be detected by calculating cross-correlation between spoofed coarse/acquisition code, referred to as C/A code, and P(Y) code. Unfortunately, this P(Y) code is only for military purpose while the C/A code can be publicly accessible. This method requires knowledge of specific key which is not revealed to the public to decrypt P(Y) code. Monitoring the direction of arrival of the signals can be one of the methods [6]. A GPS receiver measures the direction-of-arrival vector with more than 3 antennas. Even though this signal-geometrybased system with multiple antennas makes GPS robust, an attacker can spoof signals from multiple directions, which is more difficult to detect the spoofing. The idea here is to develop a system that can discriminate the spoofed signal without complex computation or heavy message exchange. An important component of AuthGPS is a verification of valid GPS satellite information via LTE base stations' location information. We propose 6-digit one-time password-based authentication system in this paper.",

In this paper, we introduce CELLI, an indoor VLP system that only uses a single luminary as the transmitter and requires only a simple light sensor to achieve an extremely high accuracy with centimeter-level error. The key idea is to provide the spatial resolution capability from the transmitter instead of the receiver, so that the complexity of the receiver can be minimized. In particular, a small LCD is installed at the transmitter to project a large number of narrow and interference-free polarized light beams to different spatial cells. A receiving light sensor identifies its located cell by detecting the unique polarization-modulated signals projected to that cell. CELLI further incorporates a number of novel designs to overcome the technical challenges such as reducing the positioning latency, which is typically limited by the long optical response time of an LCD, and transforming a cell coordinate to the global 3D position using only a single light. We have prototyped our design using off-the-shelf optical and electrical components, and experimentally shown that CELLI achieves a median 3D positioning error less than 11.8 cm and a median 2D positioning error to less than 2.7 cm.",

It can support to make decisions of mobile terminals (ex. threat assessment in an autonomous vehicle) operating in various situations under uncertain reality. Unlike a single simulation, which is executed in one mobile terminal using data collected from the same terminal, a multiple simulation, which supports to make sophisticated decisions through data collected from multiple terminals, is not only complicated to implement but also requires a large number of computations and has network delay problem in collecting data from plenty of data sources [1]. Consequently, it is impossible to implement in a single mobile terminal.",

Our system innovatively re-uses widely available WiFi signals to capture the unique physiological characteristics rooted in respiratory motions for continuous authentication. Different from existing continuous authentication approaches having limited applicable scenarios due to their dependence on restricted user behaviors (e.g., keystrokes and gaits) or dedicated sensing infrastructures, our approach can be easily integrated into any existing WiFi infrastructure to provide non-invasive continuous authentication independent of user behaviors. Specifically, we extract representative features leveraging waveform morphology analysis and fuzzy wavelet transformation of respiration signals derived from the readily available channel state information (CSI) of WiFi. A respiration-based user authentication scheme is developed to accurately identify users and reject spoofers. Extensive experiments involving 20 subjects demonstrate that the proposed system can achieve a high authentication success rate of over 93% and robustly defend against various types of attacks.",

When playing heavy 3D Android games with AOVB, however, users often suffer unsatisfactory smoothness due to the considerable overhead of full virtualization. This paper presents DAOW, a game-oriented Android emulator implementing the idea of direct Android emulation, which eliminates the overhead of full virtualization by directly executing Android app binaries on top of x86-based Windows. Based on pragmatic, efficient instruction rewriting and syscall emulation, DAOW offers foreign Android binaries direct access to the domestic PC hardware through Windows kernel interfaces, achieving nearly native hardware performance. Moreover, it leverages graphics and security techniques to enhance user experiences and prevent cheating in gaming. As of late 2018, DAOW has been adopted by over 50 million PC users to run thousands of heavy 3D Android games. Compared with AOVB, DAOW improves the smoothness by 21% on average, decreases the game startup time by 48%, and reduces the memory usage by 22%.",

However, until now the effectiveness of existing CTCs, which rely on packet-level modulation, is limited due to their low throughput (e.g., tens of bps). Our work, named WEBee, opens a promising direction for high-throughput CTC via physical-level emulation. WEBee uses a high-speed wireless radio (e.g., WiFi OFDM) to emulate the desired signals of a low-speed radio (e.g., ZigBee). Our unique emulation technique manipulates only the payload of WiFi packets, requiring neither hardware nor firmware changes in commodity technologies -- a feature allowing zero-cost fast deployment on existing WiFi infrastructure. We designed and implemented WEBee with commodity devices (Atheros AR2425 WiFi card and MicaZ CC2420) and the USRP-N210 platform (for PHY layer evaluation). Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that WEBee can achieve a more than 99% reliable parallel CTC between WiFi and ZigBee with 126 Kbps in noisy environments, a throughput about 16,000x faster than current state-of-the-art CTCs.",

                    "abstract": "Over 50 million people undergo surgeries each year in the United States, with over 70% of them filling opioid prescriptions within one week of the surgery. Due to the highly addictive nature of these opiates, a post-surgical window is a crucial time for pain management to ensure accurate prescription of opioids. Drug prescription nowadays relies primarily on self-reported pain levels to determine the frequency and dosage of pain drug. Patient pain self-reports are, however, influenced by subjective pain tolerance, memories of past painful episodes, current context, and the patient's integrity in reporting their pain level. Therefore, objective measures of pain are needed to better inform pain management.This paper explores a wearable system, named Painometry, which objectively quantifies users' pain perception based-on multiple physiological signals and facial expressions of pain. We propose a sensing technique, called sweep impedance profiling (SIP), to capture the movement of the facial muscle corrugator supercilii, one of the important physiological expressions of pain. We deploy SIP together with other biosignals, including electroencephalography (EEG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), and galvanic skin response (GSR) for pain quantification.From the anatomical and physiological correlations of pain with these signals, we designed Painometry, a multimodality sensing system, which can accurately quantify different levels of pain safely. We prototyped Painometry by building a custom hardware, firmware, and associated software. Our evaluations use the prototype on 23 subjects, which corresponds to 8832 data points from 276 minutes of an IRB-approved experimental pain-inducing protocol. Using leave-one-out cross-validation to estimate performance on unseen data shows 89.5% and 76.7% accuracy of quantification under 3 and 4 pain states, respectively.",

As the most natural way to contact with mobile devices, finger touches have shown potentials for user authentication. Most existing approaches utilize finger touches as behavioral biometrics for identifying individuals, which are vulnerable to spoofer attacks. To resist attacks for on-touch user authentication on mobile devices, this paper exploits physical characters of touching fingers by investigating active vibration signal transmission through fingers, and we find that physical characters of touching fingers present unique patterns on active vibration signals for different individuals. Based on the observation, we propose a behavior-irrelevant on-touch user authentication system, TouchPass, which leverages active vibration signals on smartphones to extract only physical characters of touching fingers for user identification. TouchPass first extracts features that mix physical characters of touching fingers and behavior biometrics of touching behaviors from vibration signals generated and received by smartphones. Then, we design a Siamese network-based architecture with a specific training sample selection strategy to reconstruct the extracted signal features to behavior-irrelevant features and further build a behavior-irrelevant on-touch user authentication scheme leveraging knowledge distillation. Our extensive experiments validate that TouchPass can accurately authenticate users and defend various attacks.",

To assist the development of these applications, we propose BeeCluster, a drone orchestration system that manages a fleet of drones. BeeCluster provides a virtual drone abstraction that enables developers to express a sequence of geographical sensing tasks, and determines how to map these tasks to the fleet efficiently. BeeCluster's core contribution is predictive optimization, in which an inferred model of the future tasks of the application is used to generate an optimized flight and sensing schedule for the drones that aims to minimize the total expected execution time.We built a prototype of BeeCluster and evaluated it on five real-world case studies with drones in outdoor environments, measuring speedups from 11.6% to 23.9%.",

                    "abstract": "In recent years, convolutional networks have demonstrated unprecedented performance in the image restoration task of super-resolution (SR). SR entails the upscaling of a single low-resolution image in order to meet application-specific image quality demands and plays a key role in mobile devices. To comply with privacy regulations and reduce the overhead of cloud computing, executing SR models locally on-device constitutes a key alternative approach. Nevertheless, the excessive compute and memory requirements of SR workloads pose a challenge in mapping SR networks on resource-constrained mobile platforms. This work presents MobiSR, a novel framework for performing efficient super-resolution on-device. Given a target mobile platform, the proposed framework considers popular model compression techniques and traverses the design space to reach the highest performing trade-off between image quality and processing speed. At run time, a novel scheduler dispatches incoming image patches to the appropriate model-engine pair based on the patch's estimated upscaling difficulty in order to meet the required image quality with minimum processing latency. Quantitative evaluation shows that the proposed framework yields on-device SR designs that achieve an average speedup of 2.13x over highly-optimized parallel difficulty-unaware mappings and 4.79x over highly-optimized single compute engine implementations.",

                    "abstract": "Despite the 4G LTE's 10X capacity improvement over 3G, mobile Web loading latency remains a major issue that hampers user experience. The root cause lies in the inefficient transport-layer that underutilizes LTE capacity, due to high channel dynamics, wireless link losses, and insufficient application traffic to propel the bandwidth probing. In this paper, we propose Cellular Link-Aware Web loading (CLAW), which boosts mobile Web loading using a physical-layer informed transport protocol. CLAW harnesses the limited PHY-layer statistics available on LTE phones to quantitatively model the LTE channel resource utilization, which is then translated into a transport window that best fits the bandwidth. Consequently, CLAW can estimate and fully utilize the available bandwidth almost within one RTT. In addition, CLAW can precisely differentiate LTE wireless loss from congestion loss, and identify the rare cases when the wireline backhaul becomes the bottleneck. We have prototyped CLAW on commodity LTE phones. Across a wide range of experimental settings, CLAW consistently reduces Web loading latency by more than 30%, compared to classical TCP variants and state-of-the-art congestion controls for cellular networks.",

                    "abstract": "LoRa, a representative Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology, has been shown as a promising platform to connect Internet of Things. Practical LoRa deployments, however, suffer from collisions, especially in dense networks and wide coverage areas expected by LoRa applications. Existing collision resolution approaches do not exploit the coding properties of LoRa and thus cannot work well for low SNR LoRa signals. We propose NScale to decompose concurrent transmissions by leveraging subtle inter-packet time offsets for low SNR LoRa collisions. NScale (1) translates subtle time offsets, which are vulnerable to noise, to robust frequency features, and (2) further amplifies the time offsets by non-stationary signal scaling, i.e., scaling the amplitude of a symbol differently at different positions. In practical implementation, we propose a noise resistant iterative symbol recovery method to combat symbol distortion in low SNR, and address frequency shifts incurred by CFO and packet time offsets in decoding. We theoretically show that NScale introduces &lt; 1.7 dB SNR loss compared with the original LoRa. We implement NScale on USRP N210 and evaluate its performance in both indoor and outdoor networks. NScale is implemented in software at the gateway and can work for COTS LoRa nodes without any modification. The evaluation results show that NScale improves the network throughput by 3.3x for low SNR collided signals compared with other state-of-the-art methods.",

However, the high cost of commercial soil moisture sensors and the inaccuracy of sub-1000 dollar EC sensors have limited their adoption. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a system, called Strobe, that senses soil moisture and soil EC using RF propagation in existing Wi-Fi bands. Strobe overcomes the key challenge of limited bandwidth availability in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed spectrum using a novel multi-antenna technique. It maps the propagation time and amplitude of Wi-Fi signals received by different antennas to the soil permittivity and EC, which in turn depend on soil moisture and salinity. Our experiments with USRP, WARP, and commodity Wi-Fi cards show that Strobe can accurately estimate soil moisture and EC using Wi-Fi, thereby showing the potential of a future where a farmer can sense soil in their farm without investing 1000s of dollars in sensing tools.",

Such balloons navigate the airspace up to 40 km, and can provide a bird's eye and clear view of terrestrial, as well as aerial spectrum use. In this paper, we present SkySense, which is an extension of the Electrosense sensing framework with mobile GPS-located sensors and local data logging. In addition, we present 6 different sensing campaigns, targeting multiple terrestrial or aerial technologies such as ADS-B, AIS or LTE. For instance, for ADS-B, we can clearly conclude that the number of airplanes that are detected is the same for each balloon altitude, but the message reception rate decreases strongly with altitude because of collisions. For each sensing campaign, the dataset is described, and some example spectrum analysis results are presented. In addition, we analyse and quantify important trends visible when sensing from the sky, such as temperature and hardware variations, increased ambient interference levels, as well as hardware limitations of the lightweight system. A key challenge is the automatic gain control and dynamic range of the system, as a radio navigating over 30km, sees a very wide range of possible signal levels. All data is publicly available through the Electrosense framework, to encourage the spectrum sensing community to further analyse the data or motivate further measurement campaigns using weather balloons.",

However, the tremendous device, hardware, and software heterogeneity of mobile systems makes this difficult. In this demo, we present M2, a system for multi-mobile computing that enables existing unmodified mobile apps to make use of new ways of sharing and combining multiple devices. M2 introduces a new data-centric approach that leverages higher-level device abstractions and encoding/decoding hardware to efficiently share device data as opposed to low-level device-specific APIs.",

In order for vehicles to obtain data, compute and other services from other vehicles or road-side infrastructure, it is important to be able to make micropayments for those services and for the services to run seamlessly despite the challenges posed by mobility and ephemeral interactions with a dynamic set of neighboring devices. We present MOTIVE, a trusted and decentralized framework that allows vehicles to make peer-to-peer micropayments for data, compute and other services obtained from other vehicles or road-side infrastructure within radio range. The framework utilizes distributed ledger technologies including smart contracts to enable autonomous operation and trusted interactions between vehicles and nearby entities.",

This paper proposes an active visual recognition approach to this problem, leveraging camera pose data available on mobile devices. With this approach, the state of a 3D object, which captures its appearance changes, can be recognized in real time. Our novel approach selects informative video frames filtered by 6-DOF camera poses to train a deep learning model to recognize object state. We validate our approach through a prototype for Augmented Reality-assisted hardware maintenance.",

Edge-SLAM offloads the compute-intensive modules of Visual-SLAM to the edge without losing accuracy. Our experiments show that Edge-SLAM architecture reduces the use of computation and memory resources on mobile devices and keeps it constant.

They need to perform a large number of measurements on the traffic simultaneously, to detect different types of anomalies such as heavy hitters or super-spreaders. Existing techniques often focus on a single statistic (e.g., traffic volume) or traffic attribute (e.g., destination IP). However, performing numerous heterogeneous measurements within the constrained memory architecture of modern network devices poses significant challenges, due to the limited number of memory accesses allowed per packet. We propose BeauCoup, a system based on the coupon collector problem, that supports multiple distinct counting queries simultaneously while making only a small constant number of memory accesses per packet. We implement BeauCoup on PISA commodity programmable switches, satisfying the strict memory size and access constraints while using a moderate portion of other data-plane hardware resources. Evaluations show BeauCoup achieves the same accuracy as other sketch-based or sampling-based solutions using 4x fewer memory access.",

However, state-of-the-art image wearables available in the market are limited to capturing images periodically and do not provide any real-time analysis of the data that might be useful for the wearers. In this paper, we present DeepEye - a match-box sized wearable camera that is capable of running multiple cloud-scale deep learn- ing models locally on the device, thereby enabling rich analysis of the captured images in near real-time without offloading them to the cloud. DeepEye is powered by a commodity wearable processor (Snapdragon 410) which ensures its wearable form factor. The software architecture for DeepEye addresses a key limitation with executing multiple deep learning models on constrained hardware, that is their limited runtime memory. We propose a novel inference software pipeline that targets the local execution of multiple deep vision models (specifically, CNNs) by interleaving the execution of computation-heavy convolutional layers with the loading of memory-heavy fully-connected layers. Beyond this core idea, the execution framework incorporates: a memory caching scheme and a selective use of model compression techniques that further minimizes memory bottlenecks. Through a series of experiments, we show that our execution framework outperforms the baseline approaches significantly in terms of inference latency, memory requirements and energy consumption.",

However, existing FL paradigms yield unsatisfactory performance for a wide class of human activity recognition (HAR) applications since they are oblivious to the intrinsic relationship between data of different users. We propose ClusterFL, a similarity-aware federated learning system that can provide high model accuracy and low communication overhead for HAR applications. ClusterFL features a novel clustered multi-task federated learning framework that maximizes the training accuracy of multiple learned models while automatically capturing the intrinsic clustering relationship among the data of different nodes. Based on the learned cluster relationship, ClusterFL can efficiently drop out the nodes that converge slower or have little correlation with other nodes in each cluster, significantly speeding up the convergence while maintaining the accuracy performance. We evaluate the performance of ClusterFL on an NVIDIA edge testbed using four new HAR datasets collected from total 145 users. The results show that, ClusterFL outperforms several state-of-the-art FL paradigms in terms of overall accuracy, and save more than 50% communication overhead at the expense of negligible accuracy degradation.",

Besides this basic function, many novel RFID-based sensing applications have been proposed in the last decade, including localization, gesture sensing, and touch sensing, among others. Nevertheless, none of these systems are in widespread use today. We hypothesize that this is because the accuracy of these systems does not meet application requirements when there are even minor changes in the RF environment or in tag geometry, i.e., changes in a tag's orientation or flexing. This paper uses both theoretical analysis and real-world experiments to test this hypothesis. Our theoretical analysis shows that even a small phase or RSS noise level can result in significant estimation errors. Our extensive real-world experiments find that both the absolute and differential values of phase and RSS readings of an RFID tag's signal can vary as much as by \u03c0 radians and 10 dB, respectively, due to small changes in the tag's orientation or flexing. Because of these large variations, RFID-based application systems relying on the signal phase or RSS cannot meet application requirements, confirming our hypothesis. In addition to this strong negative result, we also present some insights into designing robust RFID systems that are suitable for use in the real world.",

Such practices, albeit innovative and effective, require well-controlled alignment of camera and screen and obstacle-free access. In this demo, we present Dolphin, a novel form of real-time acoustics-based dual-channel communication, which uses a speaker and the microphones on off-the-shelf smartphones to achieve concurrent audible and hidden communication. By leveraging masking effects of the human auditory system and readily available audio signals in our daily lives, Dolphin ensures real-time unobtrusive speaker-microphone data communication, while, at the same time, it overcomes the main limitations of existing screen-camera links.",

When aggregate (A-MPDU) sizes are forced to be smaller the throughput benefit dwindles. During normal operation the A-MPDU sizes fall from the maximum possible due to the loss of individual constituent subframes. In the worst case, the size can be as low as a single subframe. We show that, compared to the worst case, full-sized A-MPDUs can give up to 400% higher throughput for the highest MCS indexes of 802.11ac. In this paper, we explain how fixed block ACK size coupled with subframe retransmission are the main causes of reduction in A-MPDU size. We present the modification in the block ACK mechanism needed to attain larger sizes of aggregates even in the presence of subframe losses.",

While SDR is known to be highly effective in realizing such services, they are rarely deployed or used by the end-users due to the costly hardware ~1K USD (e.g., USRP). Low-cost SDRs (e.g., RTL-SDR) are available, but their bandwidth is limited to 2-3 MHz and operation range falls well below 2.4 GHz - the unlicensed band holding majority of the wireless devices. This paper presents SDR-Lite, the first zero-cost, software-only software defined radio (SDR) receiver that empowers commodity WiFi to retrieve the In-phase and Quadrature of an ambient signal. With the full compatibility to pervasively-deployed WiFi infrastructure (without any change to the hardware and firmware), SDR-Lite aims to spread the blessing of SDR receiver functionalities to billions of WiFi users and households to enhance our everyday lives. The key idea of SDR-Lite is to trick WiFi to begin packet reception (i.e., the decoding process) when the packet is absent, so that it accepts ambient signals in the air and outputs corresponding bits. The bits are then reconstructed to the original physical-layer waveform, on which diverse SDR applications are performed. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that the reconstructed signal closely reassembles the original ambient signal (&gt;85% correlation). We extensively demonstrate SDR-Lite effectiveness across seven distinctive SDR receiver applications under three representative categories: (i) RF fingerprinting, (ii) spectrum monitoring, and (iii) (ZigBee) decoding. For instance, in security applications of drone and rogue WiFi AP detection, SDR-Lite achieves 99% and 97% accuracy, which is comparable to USRP.",

MBaaS is considered as a new service model within the range of MCC and firebase by Google has been accepted as the most popular MBaaS. However, firebase has not made the efforts for performing computation offloading, as it is expected from an MCC platform. We have contributed in two folds by 1) identifying the limitations of firebase as an MCC platform and by 2) proposing RQL (REST Query Language) as a wrapper over firebase to improve its services for achieving computational offloading. RQL is used for requesting data in the form of JSON instead of using URLs for making REST requests. We have also explained different case studies to evaluate the effectiveness of RQL for converting firebase to an MCC platform.",

Designing EagleEye involves critical technical challenges for both accuracy and latency. Firstly, despite recent advances in Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based face identification, we observe that state-of-the-art models fail to accurately identify Low-Resolution (LR) faces. Accordingly, we design a novel Identity Clarification Network to recover missing details in the LR faces, which enhances true positives by 78% with only 14% false positives. Furthermore, designing EagleEye involves unique challenges compared to recent continuous mobile vision systems in that it requires running a series of complex DNNs multiple times on a high-resolution image. To tackle the challenge, we develop Content-Adaptive Parallel Execution to optimize complex multi-DNN face identification pipeline execution latency using heterogeneous processors on mobile and cloud. Our results show that EagleEye achieves 9.07X faster latency compared to naive execution, with only 108 KBytes of data offloaded.",

                    "abstract": "Caller ID spoofing forges the authentic caller identity, thus making the call appear to originate from another user. This seemingly simple attack technique has been used in the growing telephony frauds and scam calls, resulting in substantial monetary loss and victim complaints. Unfortunately, caller ID spoofing is easy to launch, yet hard to defend; no effective and practical defense solutions are in place to date. In this paper, we propose CEIVE (Callee-only inference and verification), an effective and practical defense against caller ID spoofing. It is a victim callee only solution without requiring additional infrastructure support or changes on telephony systems. We formulate the design as an inference and verification problem. Given an incoming call, CEIVE leverages a callback session and its associated call signaling observed at the phone to infer the call state of the other party. It further compares with the anticipated call state, thus quickly verifying whether the incoming call comes from the originating number. We exploit the standardized call signaling messages to extract useful features, and devise call-specific verification and learning to handle diversity and extensibility. We implement CEIVE on Android phones and test it with all top four US mobile carriers, one landline and two small carriers. It shows 100% accuracy in almost all tested spoofing scenarios except one special, targeted attack case.",

Therefore, to efficiently manage resources and meet performance SLAs, NFV orchestrators need mechanisms to predict contention-induced performance degradation. In this work, we find that prior performance prediction frameworks suffer from poor accuracy on modern architectures and NFs because they treat memory as a monolithic whole. In addition, we show that, in practice, there exist multiple components of the memory subsystem that can separately induce contention. By precisely characterizing (1) the pressure each NF applies on the server's shared hardware resources (contentiousness) and (2) how susceptible each NF is to performance drop due to competing contentiousness (sensitivity), we develop SLOMO, a multivariable performance prediction framework for Network Functions. We show that relative to prior work SLOMO reduces prediction error by 2-5x and enables 6-14% more efficient cluster utilization. SLOMO's codebase can be found at https://github.com/cmu-snap/SLOMO.",

                    "abstract": "The performance of wireless communication systems is evolving rapidly, making it difficult to build experimentation platforms that meet the hardware requirements of new standards. The bandwidth of current systems ranges from 160 MHz for IEEE 802.11ac/ax to 2 GHz for Millimeter-Wave (mm-wave) IEEE 802.11ad/ay, and they support up to 8 spatial MIMO streams. Mobile 5G and beyond systems have a similarly diverse set of requirements.To address this, we propose a highly configurable wireless platform that meets such requirements and is both affordable and scalable. It is implemented on a single state-of-the-art FPGA board that can be configured from 4x4 mm-wave MIMO with 2 GHz channels to 8x8 MIMO with 160 MHz channels in sub-6 GHz bands. In addition, multi-band operation will play an important role in future wireless networks and our platform supports mixed configurations with simultaneous use of mm-wave and sub-6 GHz. Finally, the platform supports real-time operation, e.g., for closed-loop MIMO beam training with low-latency, by implementing suitable hardware/software accelerators. We demonstrate the platform's performance in a wide range of experiments. The platform is provided as open-source to build a community to use and extend it.",

However, when the applications are deployed in rural areas or poorly-performing networks, the images offloading usually exhausts the limited network resources. While we can certainly revamp the network links, we can also optimize the payload at the same time. In this paper, we propose a middlebox system design that exploits the patterns of similarity between consecutive camera snapshots to alleviate the network load. Our preliminary results show that despite of small errors introduced in the images, the amount of reduced payloads could be a valuable choice to alleviate poorly performing networks.",

                    "abstract": "Distributed in-memory caching is a key component of modern Internet services. Such caches are often accessed via remote procedure call (RPC), as RPC frameworks provide rich support for productionization, including protocol versioning, memory efficiency, auto-scaling, and hitless upgrades. However, full-featured RPC limits performance and scalability as it incurs high latencies and CPU overheads. Remote Memory Access (RMA) offers a promising alternative, but meeting productionization requirements can be a significant challenge with RMA-based systems due to limited programmability and narrow RMA primitives.This paper describes the design, implementation, and experience derived from CliqueMap, a hybrid RMA/RPC caching system. CliqueMap has been in production use in Google's datacenters for over three years, currently serves more than 1PB of DRAM, and underlies several end-user visible services. CliqueMap makes use of performant and efficient RMAs on the critical serving path and judiciously applies RPCs toward other functionality. The design embraces lightweight replication, client-based quoruming, self-validating server responses, per-operation client-side retries, and co-design with the network layers. These foci lead to a system resilient to the rigors of production and frequent post deployment evolution.",

Prior work utilize this technology in enabling Gbps wireless links. In contrast, we exploit mmWave technology in designing high-density IoT networks, where there are hundreds of nodes, but each requiring only a Mbps wireless link. However, existing mmWave radios are costly and have high power consumption which makes them unsuitable for IoT sensors. We have built mmPi: a low-cost and low-power mmWave radio that operates as a daughterboard for the Raspberry Pi platform. We believe that mmPi helps advance mmWave research in the IoT domain.",

It is an applied field focused on the science to characterize, understand, and forecast cyber-mediated changes in human behavior and activity, and the related social, cultural, economic and political outcomes. From the engineering side it is concerned with building the cyber-infrastructure needed for society to persist in its essential character in a cyber-mediated information environment under changing conditions, in the presence of actual or imminent social cyber-threats. Research in social cyber-security has demonstrated that social media and personalized data assistants are critical technologies that affect the ways humans navigate this cyber-mediated information space, and the way they interact and engage in discussions. This impact is complex and is related to the human socio-cognitive response, engineered features of the technologies, and the policy/legal environment in which humans and technology interact. The changing nature of interaction in the cyber-mediated information environment are creating new scientific and policy challenges that those in social cyber-security must address. This talk will describe the nature, promise of, and challenges in social cyber-security. The role of network science and AI, as to of the core methodologies, in addressing these challenges is addressed. Illustrative examples will be drawn from areas such as disaster response, state stability, and the distribution of false information.",

Our approach does not require tampering or installing software on the victim's device, or specialized hardware. The app is demonstrated by attacking keystroke dynamics, a method leveraging the unique typing behaviour of users to authenticate them on a smartphone, which was previously thought to be hard to mimic. In addition, we propose a low-tech AR-like audiovisual method based on spatial pointers on a transparent film and audio cues. We conduct experiments with 31 participants and mount over 400 attacks to show that our methods enable attackers to successfully bypass keystroke dynamics for 87% of the attacks after an average mimicry training of four minutes. Our AR-based method can be extended to attack other input behaviour-based biometrics. While the particular attack we describe is relatively narrow, it is a good example of using AR guidance to enable successful mimicry of user behaviour---an approach of increasing concern as AR functionality becomes more commonplace.",

Existing telemetry solutions often face the dilemma between resource efficiency (i.e., low CPU, memory, and bandwidth overhead) and full accuracy (i.e., error-free and holistic measurement). We break this dilemma via a network-wide architectural design OmniMon, which simultaneously achieves resource efficiency and full accuracy in flow-level telemetry for large-scale data centers. OmniMon carefully coordinates the collaboration among different types of entities in the whole network to execute telemetry operations, such that the resource constraints of each entity are satisfied without compromising full accuracy. It further addresses consistency in network-wide epoch synchronization and accountability in error-free packet loss inference. We prototype OmniMon in DPDK and P4. Testbed experiments on commodity servers and Tofino switches demonstrate the effectiveness of OmniMon over state-of-the-art telemetry designs.",

In this paper, we introduce LiShield, which automatically protects a physical scene against photographing, by illuminating it with smart LEDs flickering in specialized waveforms. We use a model-driven approach to optimize the waveform, so as to ensure protection against the (uncontrollable) cameras and potential image-processing based attacks. We have also designed mechanisms to unblock authorized cameras and enable graceful degradation under strong ambient light interference. Our prototype implementation and experiments show that LiShield can effectively destroy unauthorized capturing while maintaining robustness against potential attacks.",

In this work, we characterize a wide variety of real-world WiFi threats at an unprecedented scale, involving 19 million WiFi access points (APs) mostly located in China, by deploying a crowdsourced security checking system on 14 million mobile devices in the wild. Leveraging the collected data, we reveal the landscape of nationwide WiFi threats for the first time. We find that the prevalence, riskiness, and breakdown of WiFi threats deviate significantly from common understandings and prior studies. In particular, we detect attacks at around 4% of all WiFi APs, uncover that most WiFi attacks are driven by an underground economy, and provide strong evidence of web analytics platforms being the bottleneck of its monetization chain. Further, we provide insightful guidance for defending against WiFi attacks at scale, and some of our efforts have already yielded real-world impact---effectively disrupted the WiFi attack ecosystem.",

Hoyan has been running in production for more than two years and is currently used for all critical configuration auditing and updates on the WAN. We highlight our innovative designs and real-life experience to make Hoyan accurate and scalable in practice. For accuracy under the inconsistencies of devices' vendor-specific behaviors (VSBs), Hoyan continuously discovers the flaws in device behavior models, thus aiding the operators in fixing the models. For scalability to verify our global WAN, Hoyan introduces a \"global-simulation &amp; local formal-modeling\" strategy to model uncertainties in small scales and perform aggressive pruning of possibilities during the protocol simulations. Hoyan achieves near-100% verification accuracy after it detected and fixed O(10) VSBs on our WAN. Hoyan has prevented many potential service failures resulting from misconfiguration and reduced the failure rate of updates of our WAN by more than half in 2019.",

In MEC-NFV networks, network services are deployed in the form of service function chains (SFCs), each consisting of an ordered set of virtual network functions (VNFs). In this paper, we focus on the VNF placement problem in MEC-NFV enabled networks, aiming to optimize the throughput of SFC requests (SFCRs). First, we involve the sharing mechanism of VNF instances in the problem formulations, which can improve network resource utilization and save more node resources. Then we formulate the problem mathematically and propose a correlation-based mapping algorithm to map SFCRs in the network. Moreover, we design an adjustment algorithm to optimize the mapped SFCRs. Evaluation results show that our proposed solution efficiently improves the throughput of SFCRs compared with the benchmarks.",

In normal time, EasyGO can estimate the density of indoor people in each area and determine the moving speeds to pass through different areas. Based on the determined moving speed of each area, an indoor navigation path can be planned to provide the shortest moving time for EasyGO users. In emergent time, EasyGO can accurately estimate the escaping time for each EasyGO user by considering the capacity and length of passageways, the capacity of exits, and the current distribution and parallel moving of indoor people. Based on the estimated escaping time, EasyGO can evenly distribute the evacuation load among exits and alleviate the congestion of all passageways and exits to minimize the total escaping time. An Android-based prototype with iBeacon indoor localization is implemented to verify the feasibility of our EasyGO system.",

Our work, named Chiron, opens a promising direction for Physical (PHY) layer concurrent high throughput communication to heterogeneous IoT devices (e.g., wider-band WiFi and narrower-band ZigBee). Specifically, at the PHY layer, Chiron enables concurrently transmitting (or receiving) 1 stream of WiFi data and up to 4 streams of ZigBee data to (or from) commodity WiFi and ZigBee devices as if there is no interference between these simultaneous connections. We extensively evaluate our system under different real-world settings. Results show that Chiron's concurrent WiFi and ZigBee communication can achieve similar throughput as the sole WiFi or ZigBee communication. Chiron's spectrum utilization is more than 16 times better than the traditional gateway.",

                    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a near-ultrasound chirp signal-based communication for the TV's 2nd screen services. While near-ultrasound (with under 20 kHz frequency) communication has been developed for various applications recently, none of the previous work provides a perfect solution for 2nd screen services between TVs and smart devices. This is due mainly to the following real world challenges. The embedded signal in TV contents should be successfully received in a typical TV-watching environment by (i) delivering information at least at 15 bps with significantly low volume to avoid human perception, (ii) despite the presence of ambient noise, e.g., a tick, a snap, or a knock. To fulfill (i), we design chirp quaternary orthogonal keying (QOK) symbols. Especially, we aim to minimize inter-symbol interference (ISI) effects by symbol design in order to completely eliminate guard intervals. To resolve (ii), we propose the novel J-shape detection algorithms for both frame synchronization and carrier sensing. The proposed modem achieves almost zero frame error rate on a smartphone 2.7 m away from the TV even with minimal receive sound pressure level of 35 dBSPL, i.e., the noise level in a very quiet room. Moreover, throughout experiments and log analysis of 2nd screen service deployed in a nation-wide TV broadcasting system, J-shape detection algorithms are proven to achieve highly resilient performance for both frame synchronization and carrier sensing compared to previous schemes.",

                    "abstract": "Machine learning models, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have demonstrated great potential in optimizing video streaming applications. However, the state-of-the-art solutions are limited to an \"offline learning\" paradigm, i.e., the RL models are trained in simulators and then are operated in real networks. As a result, they inevitably suffer from the simulation-to-reality gap, showing far less satisfactory performance under real conditions compared with simulated environment. In this work, we close the gap by proposing OnRL, an online RL framework for real-time mobile video telephony. OnRL puts many individual RL agents directly into the video telephony system, which make video bitrate decisions in real-time and evolve their models over time. OnRL then aggregates these agents to form a high-level RL model that can help each individual to react to unseen network conditions. Moreover, OnRL incorporates novel mechanisms to handle the adverse impacts of inherent video traffic dynamics, and to eliminate risks of quality degradation caused by the RL model's exploration attempts. We implement OnRL on a mainstream operational video telephony system, Alibaba Taobao-live. In a month-long evaluation with 543 hours of video sessions from 151 real-world mobile users, OnRL outperforms the prior algorithms significantly, reducing video stalling rate by 14.22% while maintaining similar video quality.",

                    "abstract": "To meet the growing demand for wireless data, it is time to move away from the age-old paradigm of prohibiting interfering nodes from transmissions. Instead, through proactive management of interference among multiple colliding packets, we can design high throughput wireless systems. This is well explored in the Information Theory community and there are also a few implementational efforts that have been recently reported. The existing solutions are nontrivial to use in real systems as they require either tight time/frequency synchronization or exchange of data between transmitters prior to the transmissions. These requirements are hard to meet in practice especially for uplink transmissions. This paper proposes BASIC, a lightweight multi-user uplink transmission strategy that does not require tight synchronization or exchange of samples among nodes, which makes it an attractive alternative compared to its counterparts. BASIC exploits receiver diversity by controlling the data rates of the clients. A novel greedy algorithm is proposed for data rate selection. We implement BASIC on a software-defined radio platform. Our experiments on a real testbed show that BASIC outperforms TDMA by 48% in terms of overall throughput. Our trace-driven simulations show up to 4.8x gain in throughput with similar flow fairness.",

                    "abstract": "Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) technique has emerged as a fundamental approach to mitigate the spectrum scarcity problem. As a key form of DSA, government is proposing to release more federal spectrum for sharing with commercial wireless users. However, the flourish of federal-commercial sharing hinges upon how the federal privacy is managed. In current DSA proposals, the sensitive exclusion zone (E-Zone) information of federal incumbent users (IUs) needs to be shared with a spectrum access system (SAS) to realize spectrum allocation. However, SAS is not necessarily trust-worthy for holding the sensitive IU E-Zone data, especially considering that FCC allows some industry third parties (e.g., Google) to operate SAS for better efficiency and scalability. Therefore, the current proposals dissatisfy the IUs' privacy requirement. To address the privacy issue, this paper presents an IU-privacy-preserving SAS (IP-SAS) design, which realizes the spectrum allocation process through secure computation over ciphertext based on homomorphic encryption.",

In particular, microfine dust (microdust) is known to cause serious health issues to people. Therefore, measuring and predicting mircodust is an important problem. A typical way of measuring microdust is to use sensors from fixed location. However, this cannot capture the local dynamics of microdust and is limited to accurate measurement near fixed locations. Therefore, there is an immediate need to provide more accurate local air quality measurements in the areas where fixed local sensors are not installed. In this preliminary research, we focus on modeling the air quality pattern in a given local area by using vehicles equipped with cheap IoT sensors, where vehicles move around the area. As a pilot study, We measured the microdust level running experiments for 2 weeks with 3 different cars. Also, we developed an machine learning algorithm to better predict the local air quality using moving sensors. Further, we built an application where measured air quality is reported to the end users. We demonstrated the feasibility of using inexpensive IoT sensors in moving vehicles to provide better local air quality to end users.",

                    "abstract": "Many of the everyday decisions a user makes rely on the suggestions of online recommendation systems. These systems amass implicit (e.g.,location, purchase history, browsing history) and explicit (e.g.,reviews, ratings) feedback from multiple users, produce a general consensus, and provide suggestions based on that consensus. However, due to privacy concerns, users are uncomfortable with implicit data collection, thus requiring recommendation systems to be overly dependent on explicit feedback. Unfortunately, users do not frequently provide explicit feedback. This hampers the ability of recommendation systems to provide high-quality suggestions. We introduce Heimdall, the first privacy-respecting implicit preference collection framework that enables recommendation systems to extract user preferences from their activities in a privacy respecting manner. The key insight is to enable recommendation systems to run a collector on a user's device and precisely control the information a collector transmits to the recommendation system back-end. Heimdall introduces immutable blobs as a mechanism to guarantee this property. We implemented Heimdall on the Android platform and wrote three example collectors to enhance recommendation systems with implicit feedback. Our performance results suggest that the overhead of immutable blobs is minimal, and a user study of 166 participants indicates that privacy concerns are significantly less when collectors record only specific information--a property that Heimdall enables.",

                    "abstract": "With the recent trend of on-device deep learning, inference latency has become a crucial metric in running Deep Neural Network (DNN) models on various mobile and edge devices. To this end, latency prediction of DNN model inference is highly desirable for many tasks where measuring the latency on real devices is infeasible or too costly, such as searching for efficient DNN models with latency constraints from a huge model-design space. Yet it is very challenging and existing approaches fail to achieve a high accuracy of prediction, due to the varying model-inference latency caused by the runtime optimizations on diverse edge devices.In this paper, we propose and develop nn-Meter, a novel and efficient system to accurately predict the inference latency of DNN models on diverse edge devices. The key idea of nn-Meter is dividing a whole model inference into kernels, i.e., the execution units on a device, and conducting kernel-level prediction. nn-Meter builds atop two key techniques: (i) kernel detection to automatically detect the execution unit of model inference via a set of well-designed test cases; and (ii) adaptive sampling to efficiently sample the most beneficial configurations from a large space to build accurate kernel-level latency predictors. Implemented on three popular platforms of edge hardware (mobile CPU, mobile GPU, and Intel VPU) and evaluated using a large dataset of 26,000 models, nn-Meter significantly outperforms the prior state-of-the-art.",

In the future, they will provide us with a uniform, fully personalized, natural-language interface to all our diverse data sources, web services and IoT devices. The virtual assistant will become a powerful platform as it sees all our personal data and has great influence over the services and vendors we use. We propose a collaborative research effort to develop open-source virtual assistant technology, in concert with a commercially viable distributed infrastructure that safeguards users' data privacy, supports interoperability, and promotes open competition. To jumpstart this effort, we have developed Almond, a working open-source prototype of distributed virtual assistants. Almond lets users use natural language to share their data, IoT, and services with fine-grain control, while preserving their privacy by keeping data on their own devices. Almond also lets users issue advanced commands that monitor real-time events and connect multiple services together. This research lays the groundwork for the creation of three key open, non-proprietary, collaborative virtual assistant resources: (1) Thingpedia, a repository of virtual assistant skills, (2) LUInet (Linguistic User Interface Network), a neural network that translates natural language into ThingTalk, a virtual assistant programming language, and (3) a Distributed ThingTalk Protocol, DTP, that supports sharing with privacy via cooperating virtual assistants.",

                    "abstract": "Software-defined networking (SDN) is a mechanism that decouples a control plane from a network to manage the data plane of the network flexibly in a centralized view. In in-band-based software-defined wireless networks (IB-SDWNs), the control plane shares wireless channels with the data plane. As the amount of data-plane traffic increases, the interference from the data plane to the control plane becomes stronger, and the switches connected to the SDN controller via the control plane may become out-of-control. In this paper, we propose an interference management scheme that reduces the interference among control and data planes by adjusting the transmission rates of data-plane traffic in switches to ensure reliable connections between the SDN controller and switches. We implemented a prototype of an IB-SDWN and showed that the proposed interference management scheme ensures the reliability of control planes.",

                    "abstract": "As a key UI feature of Android, overlay enables one app to draw over other apps by creating an extra View layer on top of the host View. While greatly facilitating user interactions with multiple apps at the same time, it is often exploited by malicious apps (malware) to attack users. To combat this threat, prior countermeasures concentrate on restricting the capabilities of overlays at the OS level, while barely seeing adoption by Android due to the concern of sacrificing overlays' usability. To address this dilemma, a more pragmatic approach is to enable the early detection of overlay-based malware at the app market level during the app review process, so that all the capabilities of overlays can stay unchanged. Unfortunately, little has been known about the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach for lack of understanding of malicious overlays in the wild. To fill this gap, in this paper we perform the first large-scale comparative study of overlay characteristics in benign and malicious apps using static and dynamic analyses. Our results reveal a set of suspicious overlay properties strongly correlated with the malice of apps, including several novel features. Guided by the study insights, we build OverlayChecker, a system that is able to automatically detect overlay-based malware at market scales. OverlayChecker has been adopted by one of the world's largest Android app stores to check around 10K newly submitted apps per day. It can efficiently (within 2 minutes per app) detect nearly all (96%) overlay-based malware using a single commodity server.",

This initial adoption of the Hose model in network planning is driven by the capacity and demand uncertainty pressure of backbone expansion. Since the Hose model abstracts the aggregated traffic demand per site, peak traffic flows at different times can be multiplexed to save capacity and buffer traffic spikes. Our core design involves heuristic algorithms to select Hose-compliant traffic matrices and cross-layer optimization between the optical and IP networks. We evaluate the system performance in production and share insights from years of production experience. Hose-based network planning can save 17.4% capacity and drops 75% less traffic under fiber cuts. As the first study of Hose in network planning, our work has the potential to inspire follow-up research.",

To address this constraint, we explore a novel input mechanism, dubbed PaperKey, that enables users to interact with mobile devices by performing multi-finger typing gestures on a surface where the device is placed. Using acceleration signals on the device, PaperKey infers the user's type events and then leverages a vision based technique for detecting the exact typing locations on a paper keyboard layout. Compared to single audio, image, or vibration sensing, this work accurately localizes keystrokes with faster processing speed. Additionally, this mechanism keeps the mobility of devices by working without external sensors.",

Although environmentally friendly, the rapid promotion of electric taxis raises problems to both taxi drivers and governments, e.g., prolonged waiting/charging time, unbalanced utilization of charging infrastructures and reduced taxi supply due to the long charging time. In this paper, we make the first effort to understand the long-term evolving patterns through a five-year study on one of the largest electric taxi networks in the world, i.e., the Shenzhen electric taxi network in China. In particular, we perform a comprehensive measurement investigation called ePat to explore the evolving mobility and charging patterns of electric vehicles. Our ePat is based on 4.8 TB taxi GPS data, 240 GB taxi transaction data, and metadata from 117 charging stations, during an evolving process from 427 electric taxis in 2013 to 13,178 in 2018. Moreover, ePat also explores the impacts of various contexts and benefits during the evolving process. Our ePat as a comprehensive investigation of the electric taxi network mobility and charging evolving has the potential to advance the understanding of the evolving patterns of electric taxi networks and pave the way for analyzing future shared autonomous vehicles.",

In this work, we present ParaMax, a MIMO detector architecture that for the first time brings to bear physics-inspired parallel tempering algorithmic techniques [28, 50, 67] on this class of problems. ParaMax can achieve near optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) throughput performance in the Large MIMO regime, Massive MIMO systems where the base station has additional RF chains, to approach the number of base station antennas, in order to support even more parallel spatial streams. ParaMax is able to achieve a near ML-BER performance up to 160 \\texttimes{} 160 and 80 \\texttimes{} 80 Large MIMO for low-order modulations such as BPSK and QPSK, respectively, only requiring less than tens of processing elements. With respect to Massive MIMO systems, in 12 \\texttimes{} 24 MIMO with 16-QAM at SNR 16 dB, ParaMax achieves 330 Mbits/s near-optimal system throughput with 4--8 processing elements per subcarrier, which is approximately 1.4\\texttimes{} throughput than linear detector-based Massive MIMO systems.",

First, touch-based smartphone authentication approaches typically require explicit user interactions with the smartphone to collect sufficient touch data. These approaches may provide an attacker the opportunity to steal a victim's sensitive data before the system detects the attacker's intrusion. Likewise, an attacker may disable the continuous authentication scheme itself before detection. Second, sensor-based continuous authentication approaches inherently suffer from high energy consumption due to the constant usage of multiple sensors. In this paper, we present a novel continuous authentication system that collects light sensor data from a user's smartphone and analyzes them to authenticate users using support vector machines. We focus on the possibility of collecting light sensor data from users' smartphones while they are conducting daily behaviors to develop an anomaly detection system.",

Such practices, albeit innovative and effective, require well-controlled alignment of camera and screen and obstacle-free access.In this paper, we develop Dolphin, a novel form of real-time acoustics-based dual-channel communication, which uses a speaker and the microphones on off-the-shelf smartphones to achieve concurrent audible and hidden communication. By leveraging masking effects of the human auditory system and readily available audio signals in our daily lives, Dolphin ensures real-time unobtrusive speaker-microphone data communication without affecting the primary audio-hearing experience for human users, while, at the same time, it overcomes the main limitations of existing screen-camera links. Our Dolphin prototype, built using off-the-shelf smartphones, realizes real-time hidden communication, supports up to 8-meter signal capture distance and \u00b190\u00b0 listening angle and achieves decoding rate above 80% without error correction. Further, it achieves average data rates of up to 500bps while keeping the decoding rate above 95% within a distance of 1m.",

                    "abstract": "Small unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs) swarms are becoming ubiquitous in a number of applications (e.g., surveying, monitoring, and situational awareness). Indoor environments may contain metal equipment that temporarily disrupts radio reception. During these momentary interruptions, a small UAV needs to be able to broadcast a 'heartbeat' to indicate that it is not damaged or lost. Considering alternative messaging modalities, we observe that light-based methods require line-of sight, which is not guaranteed when UAVs are moving through a cluttered environment, while a naive sound-based method is easily drowned out by the UAV's own loud motor and propeller noise.We present Bleep, a side-channel messaging system that modulates UAV motors sounds to enable multiple UAVs to communicate when radio is unavailable. Bleep accomplishes this by 1) embedding linear chirps within the PWM frequency while maintaining the controllability of the UAV and 2) decoding the received sounds utilizing chirp multiplication to enhance signal detection in loud motor noise. Our chirp-based encoding allows multiple simultaneous transmissions to be detected and decoded in the presence of loud sounds from multiple UAV motors. Through real-world experiments, we show that Bleep is able to achieve over 95% signal detection and decoding accuracy with simultaneous transmissions.",

Similarly to other prominent examples of WiFi usage like enterprise and home settings, public WLANs could also benefit from an SDN-based coordinated management framework that deals with issues like interference and mobility management. However, unlike these settings, public WLANs present a few differences in their characteristics, such as the need to offer location-aware services and dynamic categorization of users, and the consequent need to provide sophisticated association strategies. Motivated by this we propose VALI, an SDN management framework tailored to meet the needs of public WLAN settings. We give an overview of VALI and present initial results obtained using our prototype implementation deployed over a testbed that resembles a realistic public WLAN environment. Our results demonstrate that VALI is a promising solution that could be used to effectively manage public WLAN settings and enable location-aware WiFi access.",

We present how MobileInsight evolves from a simple monitor to a community toolset with cross-layer analytics, energy-efficient real-time user-plane analytics, and extensible user-friendly analytics at the control and user planes. These features are enabled by various novel techniques, including cross-layer state machine tracking, missing data inference, and domain-specific cross-layer sampling. Their powerfulness is exemplified with a 5-year longitudinal study of operational mobile network latency using a 6.4TB dataset with 6.1 billion over-the-air messages. We further share lessons and insights of using MobileInsight by the community, as well as our visions of MobileInsight's past, present, and future.",

To do so, we leverage the coupling effect between the urine absorbed by the diaper and RFID tag, thereby the phase and amplitude variation can indicate urine pH and diaper wetness. However, rich scattering and dynamic environment exhibit a great challenge for accurate diaper wetness sensing and urine pH identification. Therefore, we propose a twin-tag based dynamic environment mitigation approach for robust and healthy diapering. Specifically, by extracting the differential amplitude and phase from the co-located sensing tag and reference tag (i.e., twin-tag) attached on the diaper, the multipath effect and the other dynamic factors (e.g., diaper wearer's body, tag's orientation and temperature, etc.) can be mitigated. Then, we detect the diaper wetness and estimate the urine pH based on differential amplitude and phase. We have implemented RFDiaper's design and evaluated its effectiveness with the experiments using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) RFID tags attached on the diaper worn by the doll and the human subjects. RFDiaper can achieve the median accuracy of around 96% for diaper wetness sensing and urine pH estimation error of around 0.23 in dynamic environment.",

Mobile edge clouds (MECs) allow the users to access the cloud services seamlessly. Although cloudlets provide a promising technique to reduce the service access latency, how to place the data-intensive service in MECs to reduce the communication overhead between different services is yet to be addressed. To attack this challenge, this paper proposes an approach for mining interacting services and placing the services on the cloudlets by optimizing the communication overhead. In this approach, a frequent itemsets mining algorithm is proposed to obtain the fine-grained frequent 2-itemsets by analyzing the cookies. This algorithm determines the minimum support threshold automatically, based on which FP-tree with FP-matrix is constructed to avoid traversing the FP-tree during the process of frequent 2-itemsets discovery, then a searching algorithm is presented to mine the discriminative frequent 2-itemsets with interestingness measure. Furthermore, the communication overhead is optimized with the capacity constraints of cloudlets. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our approach by real-world data based simulations. The results show our approach can reduce the communication overhead for service placement in MECs.",

In contrast with existing systems which utilize the physical layer for backscatter communication, we take a different approach by leveraging features of the MAC layer to communicate. WiTAG is designed to send data by selectively interfering with subframes (MPDUs) in an aggregated frame (A-MPDU). This enables standard compliant communication using modern, open or encrypted 802.11n and 802.11ac networks without requiring hardware or software modifications to any devices. We implement WiTAG using off-the-shelf components and evaluate its performance in line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight scenarios. We show that WiTAG achieves a throughput of up to 4 Kbps without impacting other devices in the network.",

The key issue of smart shelving is to locate RFID tags at any time, especially after misplacing tags. The detection of misplaced tags on stationary shelved items is very challenging due to position ambiguity, phase wrapping, device diversity, and phase ambiguity. Using a combination of theoretical analysis, simulation-based prediction and experimental verification, we propose an effective way of detecting misplaced tags, called FINDS, that integrates Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE) and Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithms to make theoretical and measured phases consistent with each other, and observe the phase shifts caused by misplaced tags. FINDS requires neither antenna movement nor external disturbances. We have implemented a prototype of FINDS with 20 tags and evaluated its performance, demonstrating FINDS's accuracy to be higher than 0.92 in the case of 2 stationary antennas.",

Prior work has implemented this functionality based on cameras, acoustic signals, and Wi-Fi via existing hardware on commercial devices. However, these methods have low user acceptance. Solutions based on cameras and acoustic signals raise privacy concerns, while WiFi-based solutions are vulnerable to background noise. As a result, these methods are not commercialized and recent flagship smartphones have implemented in-air gesture recognition by adding extra hardware on-board, such as mmWave radar and depth camera. The question is, can we support in-air gesture control on legacy devices without any hardware modifications?To answer this question, in this work, we propose SMART, an in-air gesture recognition system leveraging the screen and ambient light sensor (ALS), which are ordinary modalities on mobile devices. For the transmitter side, we design a screen display mechanism to embed spatial information and preserve the viewing experience; for the receiver side, we develop a framework to recognize gestures from low-quality ALS readings. We implement and evaluate SMART on both a tablet and several smartphones. Results show that SMART can recognize 9 types of frequently used in-air gestures with an average accuracy of 96.1%.",

We present our ongoing design and implementation of SDIF, a Secure Device Input Framework for smartphones. The core components of SDIF are a small and dedicated bare-metal hypervisor built using ARM hardware virtualization support and a user-space sandbox framework. They collectively ensures SDIF's support for unmodified OSes and apps. SDIF guarantees the secure device inputs from hardware to target applications with two key designs. The first is a design of a secure path for input data to be delivered from input device drivers to target applications. The second is a design of trusted device data reading, which ensures input data generated by hardware is faithfully put to device driver memory.",

                    "abstract": "Traditional end-host network stacks are struggling to keep up with rapidly increasing datacenter access link bandwidths due to their unsustainable CPU overheads. Motivated by this, our community is exploring a multitude of solutions for future network stacks: from Linux kernel optimizations to partial hardware offload to clean-slate userspace stacks to specialized host network hardware. The design space explored by these solutions would benefit from a detailed understanding of CPU inefficiencies in existing network stacks.This paper presents measurement and insights for Linux kernel network stack performance for 100Gbps access link bandwidths. Our study reveals that such high bandwidth links, coupled with relatively stagnant technology trends for other host resources (e.g., CPU speeds and capacity, cache sizes, NIC buffer sizes, etc.), mark a fundamental shift in host network stack bottlenecks. For instance, we find that a single core is no longer able to process packets at line rate, with data copy from kernel to application buffers at the receiver becoming the core performance bottleneck. In addition, increase in bandwidth-delay products have outpaced the increase in cache sizes, resulting in inefficient DMA pipeline between the NIC and the CPU. Finally, we find that traditional loosely-coupled design of network stack and CPU schedulers in existing operating systems becomes a limiting factor in scaling network stack performance across cores. Based on insights from our study, we discuss implications to design of future operating systems, network protocols, and host hardware.",

It integrates the emerging AR development tools (e.g., ARCore and ARKit) into its client design for achieving flexible, robust and context-aware object tracking. Our prototype implementation of Jaguar reduces the end-to-end AR latency to ~33 ms and achieves accurate six degrees of freedom (6DoF) tracking. In this demo, we will show that our Jaguar client recognizes movie posters within the camera view by offloading computation intensive tasks to edge cloud and augments these posters with their movie trailers in 3D upon receiving the recognition results.",

Instead of proposing modifications to existing home hubs, we build an independent embedded system that connects to a home hub via its audio input. Considering the aesthetics of home hubs, we envision SoundSifter as a smart sleeve or a cover for these devices. SoundSifter has hardware and software to capture the audio, isolate signals from distinct sound sources, filter out signals that are from unwanted sources, and process the signals to enforce policies such as personalization before the signals enter into an untrusted system like Amazon Echo or Google Home. We conduct empirical and real-world experiments to demonstrate that SoundSifter runs in real-time, is noise resilient, and supports selective and personalized voice commands that commercial voice-enabled home hubs do not.",

Previous solutions to the problem are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks, require additional hardware for out-of-band communication, or require an extensive public-key infrastructure. Furthermore, as the number of wireless devices explodes with the advent of the Internet of Things, it will be impractical to manually configure each device to communicate with its neighbors. Our system, CloseTalker, allows simple, secure, ad hoc communication between devices in close physical proximity, while jamming the signal so it is unintelligible to any receivers more than a few centimeters away. CloseTalker does not require any specialized hardware or sensors in the devices, does not require complex algorithms or cryptography libraries, occurs only when intended by the user, and can transmit a short burst of data or an address and key that can be used to establish long-term or long-range communications at full bandwidth. In this paper we present a theoretical and practical evaluation of CloseTalker, which exploits Wi-Fi MIMO antennas and the fundamental physics of radio to establish secure communication between devices that have never previously met. We demonstrate that CloseTalker is able to facilitate secure in-band communication between devices in close physical proximity (about 5~cm), even though they have never met nor shared a key.",

Few have been as contentious as the Google-initiated Accelerated Mobile Project (AMP), both praised for its seemingly instant mobile web experience and criticized based on concerns about the enforcement of its formats. This paper presents the first characterization of AMP's impact on users' QoE. We do this using a corpus of over 2,100 AMP webpages, and their corresponding non-AMP counterparts, based on trendy-keyword-based searches. We characterized AMP's impact looking at common web QoE metrics, including Page Load Time, Time to First Byte and SpeedIndex (SI). Our results show that AMP significantly improves SI, yielding on average a 60% lower SI than non-AMP pages without accounting for prefetching. Prefetching of AMP pages pushes this advantage even further, with prefetched pages loading over 2,000ms faster than non-prefetched AMP pages. This clear boost may come, however, at a non-negligible cost for users with limited data plans as it incurs an average of over 1.4~MB of additional data downloaded, unbeknownst to users.",

Professional runners have used interval training for a long time, alternating between high intensity sprints and low intensity jogging intervals to improve their overall performance. During such exercises, the accurate monitoring and prediction of heart rate dynamics is of particular importance to control the physiological state of a person and prevent possible pathological consequences. At the same time, heart rate estimation using very popular nowadays wearable devices (like smartwatches, fitness belts, etc.) during high-intensity exercises can be quite inaccurate. This inaccuracy mostly happens since the heart rate sensors (photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG)) are exposed to noises due to motion artifacts. PPG sensor suffers from periodic ambient light saturation due to intensive hand motions. ECG is noisy due to electrode contact area changes by body deformation. To solve the mentioned problem, in the current paper a deep learning framework for motion resistive heart rate estimation is developed. The system combines signal processing approaches for the raw sensor data processing and a deep learning architectures (convolutional and recurrent neural networks) for a real-time heart rate measurements and forecasting future heart rate dynamics.",

In this work, we explore if today's smartphones are capable of handling such high-speed network traffic. Using two high-end smartphones, we show that, contrary to previous beliefs, they can indeed support Gbps data rates without significant strain on their hardware resources. Using projections, we further show that up to 12.8 Gbps could be supported with just 50% CPU utilization. Finally, we explore the factors that make this possible and the contribution of each of them.",

                    "abstract": "\"Roam like Home\" is the initiative of the European Commission (EC) to end the levy of extra charges when roaming within the European region. As a result, people are able to use data services more freely across Europe. However, the implications roaming solutions have on performance have not been carefully examined. This paper provides an in-depth characterization of the implications of international data roaming within Europe. We build a unique roaming measurement platform using 16 different mobile networks deployed in six countries across Europe. Using this platform, we measure different aspects of international roaming in 3G and 4G networks, including mobile network configuration, performance characteristics, and content discrimination. We find that operators adopt common approaches to implementing roaming, resulting in additional latency penalties of \u223c60 ms or more, depending on geographical distance. Considering content accessibility, roaming poses additional constraints that leads to only minimal deviations when accessing content in the original country. However, geographical restrictions in the visited country make the picture more complicated and less intuitive.",

                    "abstract": "Map matching for cellular data is to transform a sequence of cell tower locations to a trajectory on a road map. It is an essential processing step for many applications, such as traffic optimization and human mobility analysis. However, most current map matching approaches are based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) that have heavy computation overhead to consider high-order cell tower information. This paper presents a fast map matching framework for cellular data, named as DMM, which adopts a recurrent neural network (RNN) to identify the most-likely trajectory of roads given a sequence of cell towers. Once the RNN model is trained, it can process cell tower sequences as making RNN inference, resulting in fast map matching speed. To transform DMM into a practical system, several challenges are addressed by developing a set of techniques, including spatial-aware representation of input cell tower sequences, an encoder-decoder framework for map matching model with variable-length input and output, and a reinforcement learning based model for optimizing the matched outputs. Extensive experiments on a large-scale anonymized cellular dataset reveal that DMM provides high map matching accuracy (precision 80.43% and recall 85.42%) and reduces the average inference time of HMM-based approaches by 46.58\\texttimes{}.",

Our solution takes a blackbox approach to secure IoT edge-networks. We combine user and device-centric context-information together with network data to classify network communication as normal or malicious. We have designed a dual-layer traffic classification scheme based on fuzzy logic, where the classification model is trained remotely. The remotely trained model is then used by the edge gateway to classify the network traffic. We have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype and evaluate its performance in a real world environment. Theevaluation shows that IoTurva causes very small overhead while it works with minimal hardware, and that our model training and classification approach can improve system efficiency and privacy.",

We show that, despite the deployed security mechanisms on both control-plane signaling and data-plane packet forwarding, novel data-plane signaling attacks are still feasible. Such attacks exhibit a variety of attack forms beyond simplistic packet-blasting, denial-of-service (DoS) threats, including location privacy breach, packet delivery loop, prolonged data delivery, throughput limiting, radio resource draining, and connection reset. Our testbed evaluation and operational network validation have confirmed the viability. We further propose a new defense solution within the 3GPP C-IoT standard framework.",

This paper introduces an open platform for experimenting with fine time measurements and a general, repeatable, and accurate measurement framework for evaluating time-based ranging systems. We analyze the key factors and parameters that affect the ranging performance and revisit standard error correction techniques for WiFi time-based ranging system. The results confirm that meter-level ranging accuracy is possible as promised, but the measurements also show that this can only be consistently achieved in low-multipath environments such as open outdoor spaces or with denser access point deployments to enable ranging at or above 80 MHz bandwidth.",

Voice assistants such as Alexa, Siri, and Google Now, have become our everyday fixtures, especially when/where touch interfaces are inconvenient or even dangerous to use, such as driving or exercising. The open nature of the voice channel makes voice assistants difficult to secure, and hence exposed to various threats as demonstrated by security researchers. To defend against these threats, we present VAuth, the first system that provides continuous authentication for voice assistants. VAuth is designed to fit in widely-adopted wearable devices, such as eyeglasses, earphones/buds and necklaces, where it collects the body-surface vibrations of the user and matches it with the speech signal received by the voice assistant's microphone. VAuth guarantees the voice assistant to execute only the commands that originate from the voice of the owner. We have evaluated VAuth with 18 users and 30 voice commands and find it to achieve 97% detection accuracy and less than 0.1% false positive rate, regardless of VAuth's position on the body and the user's language, accent or mobility. VAuth successfully thwarts various practical attacks, such as replay attacks, mangled voice attacks, or impersonation attacks. It also incurs low energy and latency overheads and is compatible with most voice assistants.",

The paralysis usually occurs on just one side of the face, and clinical trials show that electrical stimulation could trigger blink. Based on such observations, we design and implement a pair of smart glasses iBlink to assist facial paralysis patients to blink. The basic idea is to monitor the normal side of the face with a camera and stimulate the paralysed side, so that the blink of the both eyes become symmetric. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first piece of wearable device for facial paralysis therapy. Our contributions are: First, we propose an eye-blink detection mechanism based on deep convolutional neural network (CNN), which can detect asymmetric blinks of patients under various illumination conditions with an accuracy above 99%. Our eye-image library for training CNN models is published online for further related studies, which contains more than $30,000$ eye images. Second, we design and implement an automatic stimulation circuits to generate electrical impulse for stimulating the patient's facial nerve branches, which can configure operational parameters in a self-adaptive manner for different patients. Third, we implement the entire iBlink system, which integrates the two functions above and a communication function module for tele-medicine applications. Moreover, we conduct clinical trials in a hospital, in order to obtain the design basis and verify effectiveness of our device.",

A mobility platform should allocate tasks to vehicles and schedule them in order to optimize both throughput and fairness across customers. However, existing approaches to scheduling tasks in mobility platforms ignore fairness.We introduce Mobius, a system that uses guided optimization to achieve both high throughput and fairness across customers. Mobius supports spatiotemporally diverse and dynamic customer demands. It provides a principled method to navigate inherent tradeoffs between fairness and throughput caused by shared mobility. Our evaluation demonstrates these properties, along with the versatility and scalability of Mobius, using traces gathered from ridesharing and aerial sensing applications. Our ridesharing case study shows that Mobius can schedule more than 16,000 tasks across 40 customers and 200 vehicles in an online manner.",

                    "abstract": "We report on experiences with Swift congestion control in Google datacenters. Swift targets an end-to-end delay by using AIMD control, with pacing under extreme congestion. With accurate RTT measurement and care in reasoning about delay targets, we find this design is a foundation for excellent performance when network distances are well-known. Importantly, its simplicity helps us to meet operational challenges. Delay is easy to decompose into fabric and host components to separate concerns, and effortless to deploy and maintain as a congestion signal while the datacenter evolves. In large-scale testbed experiments, Swift delivers a tail latency of &lt;50\u03bcs for short RPCs, with near-zero packet drops, while sustaining ~100Gbps throughput per server. This is a tail of &lt;3x the minimal latency at a load close to 100%. In production use in many different clusters, Swift achieves consistently low tail completion times for short RPCs, while providing high throughput for long RPCs. It has loss rates that are at least 10x lower than a DCTCP protocol, and handles O(10k) incasts that sharply degrade with DCTCP.",

Recently, studies show that during the process of VLC transmission, besides the visible light signals, the transmitter also leaks out RF signals through a side channel. What is interesting is that the data transmitted in the VLC channel can be inferred from the leaked RF signals. Fundamentally, it means the leaked RF signals carry a copy of the same data in the VLC channel. In this work, we show for the first time that besides inferring the original VLC data, the leaked side channel can be smartly leveraged to carry new data, significantly increasing the data rate of current VLC systems. To realize this objective, we propose a system named RadioInLight, with designs spanning across hardware and software. Without any dedicated active RF transmission front-end which consumes power and hardware resources, RadioInLight is able to double the data rate of the VLC system by purely manipulating the free passively leaked RF signals without affecting the data rate of the original VLC transmissions.",

A number of research have been explored on enriching family interaction by augmenting an interaction channel with asynchronous communication [6] or additional sensory stimuli [5]. However, it is still far from achieving a sense of living together for family members involuntarily living apart, especially in context-aware impromptu interaction. For families living together, it is trivial to naturally perceive behavioral and situational contexts of the other and initiate a relevant interaction intuitively. For example, a wife starts a casual chat with asking her husband what he is going to cook when she sees him going to the kitchen or hears a simmering sound.",

Built with specific design goals and principles, they are vastly different, each using its own hardware and software. Thus, they are not interoperable and require different hardware.One may, therefore, ask a simple, yet seemingly impossible question: \u201cCan we transmit Bluetooth packets on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) WiFi hardware?\u201d We answer this question positively by designing, implementing and demonstrating a novel system called BlueFi. It can readily run on existing, widely-deployed WiFi devices without modifying NIC firmware/hardware. BlueFi works by reversing the signal processing of WiFi hardware and finds special 802.11n packets that are decodable by unmodified Bluetooth devices. With BlueFi, every 802.11n device can be used simultaneously as a Bluetooth device, which instantly increases the coverage of Bluetooth, thanks to the omnipresence of WiFi devices. BlueFi is particularly useful for WiFi-only devices or environments.We implement and evaluate BlueFi on devices with widely-adopted WiFi chips. We also construct two prevalent end-to-end apps \u2014 Bluetooth beacon and audio \u2014 to showcase the practical use of BlueFi. The former allows ordinary APs to send location beacons; the latter enables WiFi chips to stream Bluetooth audio in real time.",

Such eavesdroppers employ passive receivers that only listen and never transmit any signals making them very hard to detect. In this paper, we show that even passive receivers leak RF signals on the wireless medium. This RF leakage, however, is extremely weak and buried under noise and other transmitted signals that can be 3-5 orders of magnitude larger. Hence, it is missed by today's radios. We design and build Ghostbuster, the first device that can reliably extract this leakage, even when it is buried under ongoing transmissions, in order to detect the hidden presence of eavesdroppers. Ghostbuster does not require any modifications to current transmitters and receivers and can accurately detect the eavesdropper in the presence of ongoing transmissions. Empirical results show that Ghostbuster can detect eavesdroppers with more than 95% accuracy up to 5 meters away.",

It helps developers quickly realize their ideas by using a high-level Matlab script, and test them on various OS platforms, such as Android, iOS, Tizen, and Linux/Win. LibAS simplifies the development of acoustic sensing apps by hiding the platform-dependent details. For example, developers need not learn Objective-C/SWIFT or the audio buffer management in the CoreAudio framework when they want to implement acoustic sensing algorithms on an iPhone. Instead, developers only need to decide on the sensing signals and the callback function to handle each repetition of sensing signals. We have implemented apps covering three major acoustic sensing categories to demonstrate the benefits and simplicity of developing apps with LibAS. Our evaluation results show the adaptability of LibAS in supporting various acoustic sensing apps and tuning/improving their performance efficiently. Developers have reported that LibAS saves them a significant amount of time/effort and can reduce up to 90% lines of code in their acoustic sensing apps.",

However, it requires manually selecting the middle-box components to offload and rewriting the offloaded code in P4, a domain-specific language for programmable switches. We design and implement Gallium, a compiler that transforms an input software middlebox into two parts---a P4 program that runs on a programmable switch and an x86 non-offloaded program that runs on a regular middlebox server. Gallium ensures that (1) the combined effect of the P4 program and the non-offloaded program is functionally equivalent to the input middlebox program, (2) the P4 program respects the resource constraints in the programmable switch, and (3) the run-to-completion semantics are met under concurrent execution. Our evaluations show that Gallium saves 21-79% of processing cycles and reduces latency by about 31% across various software middleboxes.",

However, few of the developed solutions have been deployed in practice to satisfy the localization demand of today's smart devices, which lack ultrasonic sensors and were considered as being \"deaf'' to ultrasound. A recent finding demonstrates that ultrasound may be audible to the smart devices under certain conditions due to their microphone's nonlinearity. Inspired by this insight, this work revisits the ultrasonic positioning technique and builds a practical UPS, called UPS+, for ultrasound-incapable smart devices. The core concept is to deploy two types of indoor beacon devices, which will advertise ultrasonic beacons at two different ultrasonic frequencies respectively. Their superimposed beacons are shifted to a low-frequency by virtue of the nonlinearity effect at the receiver's microphone. This underlying property functions as an implicit ultrasonic downconverter without throwing harm to the hearing system of humans. We demonstrate UPS+, a fully functional UPS prototype, with centimeter-level localization accuracy using custom-made beacon hardware and well-designed algorithms.",

However, current data plane programs are written in low-level, chip-specific languages (e.g., P4 and NPL) and thus tightly coupled to the chip-specific architecture. As a result, it is arduous and error-prone to develop, maintain, and composite data plane programs in production networks. This paper presents Lyra, the first cross-platform, high-level language &amp; compiler system that aids the programmers in programming data planes efficiently. Lyra offers a one-big-pipeline abstraction that allows programmers to use simple statements to express their intent, without laboriously taking care of the details in hardware; Lyra also proposes a set of synthesis and optimization techniques to automatically compile this \"big-pipeline\" program into multiple pieces of runnable chip-specific code that can be launched directly on the individual programmable switches of the target network. We built and evaluated Lyra. Lyra not only generates runnable real-world programs (in both P4 and NPL), but also uses up to 87.5% fewer hardware resources and up to 78% fewer lines of code than human-written programs.",

In this work, we uncover three vulnerabilities of the current SIM practice. We show that the PIN-based access control may expose the in-SIM data to an adversary through both hardware and software. Once exposed, such in-SIM information can be used to reconstruct various keys used for device authentication, data encryption, etc. They thus enable a number of attacks, including traffic eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attack, impersonation, etc. The fundamental problem is that, the current SIM design does not offer proper authentication and fine-grained access control to hundreds of in-SIM files for various in-card applets and off-card units. We next propose a new solution that offers both authentication and fine-grained access control. Our implementation and evaluation have confirmed the viability of our proposal.",

                    "abstract": "Recent advances in IoT, machine learning and cloud computing have placed a huge strain on wireless networks. In particular, many emerging applications require streaming rich content (such as videos) in real time, while they are constrained by energy sources. A wireless network which supports high data-rate while consuming low-power would be very attractive for these applications. Unfortunately, existing wireless networks do not satisfy this requirement. For example, WiFi backscatter and Bluetooth networks have very low power consumption, but their data-rate is very limited (less than a Mbps). On the other hand, modern WiFi and mmWave networks support high throughput, but have a high power consumption (more than a watt).To address this problem, we present mmTag, a novel mmWave backscatter network which enables low-power high-throughput wireless links for emerging applications. mmTag is a backscatter system which operates in the mmWave frequency bands. mmTag addresses the key challenges that prevent existing backscatter networks from operating at mmWave bands. We implemented mmTag and evaluated its performance empirically. Our results show that mmTag is capable of achieving 1 Gbps and 100 Mbps at 4.6 m and 8 m, respectively, while consuming only 2.4 nJ/bit.",

Traditional centralized lock managers can easily support policies between multiple users using global knowledge, but they suffer from low performance. In contrast, emerging decentralized approaches are faster but cannot provide flexible policy support. Furthermore, performance in both cases is limited by the server capability.We present NetLock, a new centralized lock manager that co-designs servers and network switches to achieve high performance without sacrificing flexibility in policy support. The key idea of NetLock is to exploit the capability of emerging programmable switches to directly process lock requests in the switch data plane. Due to the limited switch memory, we design a memory management mechanism to seamlessly integrate the switch and server memory. To realize the locking functionality in the switch, we design a custom data plane module that efficiently pools multiple register arrays together to maximize memory utilization We have implemented a NetLock prototype with a Barefoot Tofino switch and a cluster of commodity servers. Evaluation results show that NetLock improves the throughput by 14.0-18.4x, and reduces the average and 99% latency by 4.7-20.3x and 10.4-18.7x over DSLR, a state-of-the-art RDMA-based solution, while providing flexible policy support.",

Malware does so by either forging user inputs or tricking users into making unintended requests to online service providers. Such malware is hard to detect and generates large revenues for cybercriminals, which is often used for committing ad/click frauds, faking reviews/ratings, promoting people or business on social networks, etc.We find that this class of malware is possible due to the lack of practical and robust means for service providers to verify the authenticity of user-driven operations (i.e., operations supposed to be performed, or explicitly confirmed, by a user). We design and build the VButton system to fill this void. Our system introduces a class of attestation-enabled app UI widgets (called VButton UI). Developers can easily integrate VButton UI in their apps to allow service providers to verify that a user-driven operation triggered by a VButton UI is indeed initiated and intended by a real user. Our system contains an on-device Manager, and a server-side Verifier. Leveraging ARM TrustZone, our system can attest operation authenticity even in the presence of a compromised OS. We have implemented the VButton system on an ARM development board as well as a commercial off-the-shelf smartphone. The evaluation results show that the system incurs negligible overhead.",

QR codes are also gaining importance in the retail sector as a convenient mobile payment method. However, researchers have concerns regarding the security of QR codes, which leave users susceptible to financial loss or private information leakage. In this study, we address this issue by developing a novel QR code (called mQR code), which exploits patterns presenting a specific spatial frequency as a form of camouflage. When the targeted receiver holds a camera in a designated position (e.g., directly in front at a distance of 30 cm from the camouflaged QR code), the original QR code is revealed in form of a Moir\\'{e} pattern. From any other position, only the camouflaged QR code can be seen. In experiments, the decryption rate of mQR codes is $&gt; 98%$. The decryption rate for cameras positioned $20degree$ off axis or $&gt; 10cm$ from the designated location drops to $0%$, indicating that any attackers will be unable to steal a usable image.",

Based on our proposed Seed-Assisted Specification method, we start to investigate this topic by looking closely into one emergency call failure case in China. Using what we learned from the case as prior knowledge, we build a formal model of emergency call systems with proper granularity. By running model checking, four public-unaware scenarios where emergency calls cannot be correctly routed are discovered. Additionally, we extract configurations of two major U.S. carriers and incorporate them as model constraints into the model. Based on the augmented model, we find two new attacks leveraging the privileges of emergency calls. Finally, we present a solution with marginal overhead to resolve issues we can foresee.",

                    "abstract": "Visible Light Communication (VLC) emerges as a new wireless communication technology with appealing benefits not present in radio communication. However, current VLC designs commonly require LED lights to emit shining light beams, which greatly limits the applicable scenarios of VLC (e.g., in a sunny day when indoor lighting is not needed). It also entails high energy overhead and unpleasant visual experiences for mobile devices to transmit data using VLC. We design and develop DarkLight, a new VLC primitive that allows light-based communication to be sustained even when LEDs emit extremely-low luminance. The key idea is to encode data into ultra-short, imperceptible light pulses. We tackle challenges in circuit designs, data encoding/decoding schemes, and DarkLight networking, to efficiently generate and reliably detect ultra-short light pulses using off-the-shelf, low-cost LEDs and photodiodes. Our DarkLight prototype supports 1.3-m distance with 1.6-Kbps data rate. By loosening up VLC's reliance on visible light beams, DarkLight presents an unconventional direction of VLC design and fundamentally broadens VLC's application scenarios.",

                    "abstract": "Localization in urban environments is becoming increasingly important and used in tools such as ARCore [11], ARKit [27] and others. One popular mechanism to achieve accurate indoor localization as well as a map of the space is using Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (Visual-SLAM). However, Visual-SLAM is known to be resource-intensive in memory and processing time. Further, some of the operations grow in complexity over time, making it challenging to run on mobile devices continuously. Edge computing provides additional compute and memory resources to mobile devices to allow offloading of some tasks without the large latencies seen when offloading to the cloud. In this paper, we present Edge-SLAM, a system that uses edge computing resources to offload parts of Visual-SLAM. We use ORB-SLAM2 as a prototypical Visual-SLAM system and modify it to a split architecture between the edge and the mobile device. We keep the tracking computation on the mobile device and move the rest of the computation, i.e., local mapping and loop closure, to the edge. We describe the design choices in this effort and implement them in our prototype. Our results show that our split architecture can allow the functioning of the Visual-SLAM system long-term with limited resources without affecting the accuracy of operation. It also keeps the computation and memory cost on the mobile device constant which would allow for deployment of other end applications that use Visual-SLAM.",

The dehydration causes many severe health problems like organ and cognitive impairment. Therefore, it is critical for the human to drink water in a sustained manner to avoid dehydration. To prevent humans from dehydration, continuous day-scale tracking of the water intake is needed. In this paper, we propose an unobtrusive method to recognize the drinking activity as well as estimate the water intake amount in milliliter scale by leveraging smartwatches. Our basic idea is to track the arm motion and discriminate the drinking activities from the similar hand-based motions like food intake, phone calls, etc. Thereafter, we estimate the water intake amount from the drinking duration.",

This interferes with omnipresent WiFi in the same 2.4 GHz ISM band. In our demonstration, we will present Software Defined Radio (SDR) based single antenna and multi-antenna prototype of standard-compliant IEEE 802.11g receiver. Our receiver prototype is capable of significantly reducing the packet error rate while facing multiple co-channel narrowband ZigBee interferers. We also demonstrate a real-time SDR implementation of Soft Bit Maximal Ratio Combiner capable of decoding frames from standard compliant IEEE 802.11g transmitters. This is a first of its kind implementation to the best of author's knowledge. The demonstrations use Ettus B210 as SDR hardware and a combination of signal processing modules from two different SDR packages: GNU Radio and Openairinterface.",

These systems usually run multiple applications concurrently and their available resources at runtime are dynamic due to events such as starting new applications, closing existing applications, and application priority changes. In this paper, we present NestDNN, a framework that takes the dynamics of runtime resources into account to enable resource-aware multi-tenant on-device deep learning for mobile vision systems. NestDNN enables each deep learning model to offer flexible resource-accuracy trade-offs. At runtime, it dynamically selects the optimal resource-accuracy trade-off for each deep learning model to fit the model's resource demand to the system's available runtime resources. In doing so, NestDNN efficiently utilizes the limited resources in mobile vision systems to jointly maximize the performance of all the concurrently running applications. Our experiments show that compared to the resource-agnostic status quo approach, NestDNN achieves as much as 4.2% increase in inference accuracy, 2.0\\texttimes{} increase in video frame processing rate and 1.7\\texttimes{} reduction on energy consumption.",

                    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the progressive loss of dopaminergic nerve cells. People with PD usually demonstrate deficits in performing basic daily activities, and the relevant annual social cost can reach about $25 billion in the United States. Early detection of PD plays an important role in symptom relief and improvement in the performance of activities in daily life (ADL), which eventually reduces societal and economic burden. However, conventional PD detection methods are inconvenient in daily life (e.g., requiring users to wear sensors). To overcome this challenge, we propose and identify the non-speech body sounds as the new PD biomarker, and utilize the data in smartphone usage to realize the passive PD detection in daily life without interrupting the user. Specifically, we present PDVocal, an end-to-end smartphone-based privacy-preserving system towards early PD detection. PDVocal can passively recognize the PD digital biomarkers in the voice data during daily phone conversation. At the user end, PDVocal filters the audio stream and only extracts the non-speech body sounds (e.g., breathing, clearing throat and swallowing) which contain no privacy-sensitive content. At the cloud end, PDVocal analyzes the body sounds of interest and assesses the health condition using a customized residual network. For the sake of reliability in real-world PD detection, we investigate the method of the performance optimizer including an opportunistic learning knob and a long-term tracking protocol. We evaluate our proposed PDVocal on a collected dataset from 890 participants and real-life conversations from publicly available data sources. Results indicate that non-speech body sounds are a promising digital biomarker for privacy-preserving PD detection in daily life.",

We present P2LoRa, the first ambient LoRa backscatter system with parallel decoding and long-range communication. The high level idea of P2LoRa is to modulate data by shifting ambient LoRa packets with a small frequency. To achieve long distance communication, we enhance the SNR of the backscatter signal by concentrating leaked energy in both the frequency domain and time domain. We propose a method to accurately reconstruct and cancel the in-band excitation signal, which is orders of magnitude higher than the backscatter signal. For parallel decoding, we propose a method to cancel inter-tag interference with very low overhead and address the signal misalignment problem due to different time of flight. We prototype the P2LoRa tag with customized low-cost hardware and implement the P2LoRa gateway on USRP. Through extensive evaluations, we show that P2LoRa achieves a long communication distance of 2.2 km with ambient LoRa, and supports 101 parallel tag transmissions.",

However, a key challenge exists for accepting videos from untrusted sources: establishing when a particular video was taken. Once a video has been received or posted publicly, it is evident that the video was created before that time, but there are no current methods for establishing how long it was made before that time.We propose C-141, a system that assures the earliest timestamp, tb, of drone-made videos. C-14 provides a challenge to an untrusted drone requiring it to execute a sequence of motions, called a motion program, revealed only after tb. It then uses camera pose estimation techniques to verify the resulting video matches the challenge motion program, thus assuring the video was taken after tb. We demonstrate the system on manually crafted programs representing a large space of possible motion programs. We also propose and evaluate an example algorithm which generates motion programs based on a seed value released after tb. C-14 incorporates a number of compression and sampling techniques to reduce the computation required to verify videos. We can verify a 59-second video from an eight-motion, manual motion program, in 91 seconds of computation with a false positive rate of one in 1013 and no false negatives. We can also verify a 190-second video from an algorithmically derived, 4-motion program, in 158 seconds of computation with a false positive rate of one in one hundred thousand and no false negatives.",

                    "abstract": "3D orientation tracking is an essential ingredient for many Internet-of-Things applications. Yet existing orientation tracking systems commonly require motion sensors that are only available on battery-powered devices. In this paper, we propose Tagyro, which attaches an array of passive RFID tags as orientation sensors on everyday objects. Tagyro uses a closed-form model to transform the run-time phase offsets between tags into orientation angle. To enable orientation tracking in 3D space, we found the key challenge lies in the imperfect radiation pattern of practical tags, caused by the antenna polarity, non-isotropic emission and electromagnetic coupling, which substantially distort phase measurement. We address these challenges by designing a set of phase sampling and recovery algorithms, which together enable reliable orientation sensing with 3 degrees of freedom. We have implemented a real-time version of Tagyro on a commodity RFID system. Our experiments show that Tagyro can track the 3D orientation of passive objects with a small error of 4\u00b0, at a processing rate of 37.7 samples per second.",

It takes a viewport-adaptive approach, which fetches only portions of a panoramic scene that cover what a viewer is about to perceive. We conduct an IRB-approved user study where we collect head movement traces from 130 diverse users to gain insights on how to design the viewport prediction mechanism for Flare. We then develop novel online algorithms that determine which spatial portions to fetch and their corresponding qualities. We also innovate other components in the streaming pipeline such as decoding and server-side transmission. Through extensive evaluations (~400 hours' playback on WiFi and ~100 hours over LTE), we show that Flare significantly improves the QoE in real-world settings. Compared to non-viewport-adaptive approaches, Flare yields up to 18x quality level improvement on WiFi, and achieves high bandwidth reduction (up to 35%) and video quality enhancement (up to 4.9x) on LTE.",

                    "abstract": "Mobile advertisements influence customers' in-store purchases and boost in-store sales for brick-and-mortar retailers. Targeting mobile ads has become significantly important to compete with online shopping. The key to enabling targeted mobile advertisement and service is to learn shoppers' interest during their stay in the store. Precise shopper tracking and identification are essential to gain the insights. However, existing sensor-based or vision-based solutions are neither practical nor accurate; no commercial solutions today can be readily deployed in a large store. On the other hand, we recognize that most retail stores have the installation of surveillance cameras, and most shoppers carry Bluetooth-enabled smartphones. Thus, in this paper, we propose TAR to learn shoppers' in-store interest via accurate multi-camera people tracking and identification. TAR leverages widespread camera deployment and Bluetooth proximity information to accurately track and identify shoppers in the store. TAR is composed of four novel design components: (1) a deep neural network (DNN) based visual tracking, (2) a user trajectory estimation by using shopper visual and BLE proximity trace, (3) an identity matching and assignment to recognize shopper's identity, and (4) a cross-camera calibration algorithm. TAR carefully combines these components to track and identify shoppers in real-time. TAR achieves 90% accuracy in two different real-life deployments, which is 20% better than the state-of-the-art solution.",

In this paper we explore the 150-174 MHz spectrum for long range IoT networks comprising unlicensed MURS and licensed VHF narrowbands. Range in these bands is boosted by the lower RF frequencies as well as higher transmit powers allowed by the FCC. Through a 400 sq km wide area deployment study, we show that, these spectrum bands can provide &gt; 20\\texttimes{} the geographical coverage than that in the 900 MHz ISM band LoRa. Increased range translates to greater uplink IoT device traffic. The key contribution of this paper is a novel technique - Blind Distributed MU-MIMO, that allows capacity to scale with the number of antennas (base- stations) while not requiring any coordinated channel measurements between the devices and IoT base- stations. This requirement is crucial since in IoT networks power constrained IoT devices typically sleep and wake up to transmit short messages in response to unpredictable events without any coordination with the base-stations. We demonstrate the efficacy of Blind Distributed MU-MIMO through a real wide area deployment.",

                    "abstract": "Smart earbuds are recognized as a new wearable platform for personal-scale human motion sensing. However, due to the interference from head movement or background noise, commonly-used modalities (e.g. accelerometer and microphone) fail to reliably detect both intense and light motions. To obviate this, we propose OESense, an acoustic-based in-ear system for general human motion sensing. The core idea behind OESense is the joint use of the occlusion effect (i.e., the enhancement of low-frequency components of bone-conducted sounds in an occluded ear canal) and inward-facing microphone, which naturally boosts the sensing signal and suppresses external interference. We prototype OESense as an earbud and evaluate its performance on three representative applications, i.e., step counting, activity recognition, and hand-to-face gesture interaction. With data collected from 31 subjects, we show that OESense achieves 99.3% step counting recall, 98.3% recognition recall for 5 activities, and 97.0% recall for five tapping gestures on human face, respectively. We also demonstrate that OESense is compatible with earbuds' fundamental functionalities (e.g. music playback and phone calls). In terms of energy, OESense consumes 746 mW during data recording and recognition and it has a response latency of 40.85 ms for gesture recognition. Our analysis indicates such overhead is acceptable and OESense is potential to be integrated into future earbuds.",

Our proposal incorporates position inaccuracies in the calculations, and the diversity of collection conditions of crowdsourced GNSS positions is used to mitigate bias and noise from the data. A binary classification model is trained and evaluated on multiple urban scenarios. Our results show that the generalization accuracy for a Random Forest classifier lies between 79% and 91%, demonstrating the potential of the proposed method for building 3D maps for wide urban areas. In the demo, we show multiple 3D visualizations of the various processing stages, which can be viewed interactively using Google Earth, allowing hands-on exploration of the work.",

                    "abstract": "The automotive industry is increasingly employing software- based solutions to provide value-added features on vehicles, especially with the coming era of electric vehicles and autonomous driving. The ever-increasing cyber components of vehicles (i.e., computation, communication, and control), however, incur new risks of anomalies, as demonstrated by the millions of vehicles recalled by different manufactures. To mitigate these risks, we design B-Diag, a battery-based diagnostics system that guards vehicles against anomalies with a cyber-physical approach, and implement B-Diag as an add-on module of commodity vehicles attached to automotive batteries, thus providing vehicles an additional layer of protection. B-Diag is inspired by the fact that the automotive battery operates in strong dependency with many physical components of the vehicle, which is observable as correlations between battery voltage and the vehicle's corresponding operational parameters, e.g., a faster revolutions-per-minute (RPM) of the engine, in general, leads to a higher battery voltage. B-Diag exploits such physically-induced correlations to diagnose vehicles by cross-validating the vehicle information with battery voltage, based on a set of data-driven norm models constructed online. Such a design of B-Diag is steered by a dataset collected with a prototype system when driving a 2018 Subaru Crosstrek in real-life over 3 months, covering a total mileage of about 1, 400 miles. Besides the Crosstrek, we have also evaluated B-Diag with driving traces of a 2008 Honda Fit, a 2018 Volvo XC60, and a 2017 Volkswagen Passat, showing B-Diag detects vehicle anomalies with &gt;86% (up to 99%) averaged detection rate.",

                    "abstract": "Future WLAN devices will combine both IEEE 802.11ad and 802.11ac interfaces. The former provides multi-Gbps rates but is susceptible to blockage, whereas the latter is slower but offers reliable connectivity. A fundamental challenge is thus how to combine those complementary technologies, to make the most of the advantages they offer. In this work, we explore leveraging Multipath TCP (MPTCP) to use both interfaces simultaneously in order to achieve a higher overall throughput as well as seamlessly switching to a single interface when the other one fails. We find that standard MPTCP often performs sub-optimally and may even yield a throughput much lower than that of single path TCP over the faster of the two interfaces. We analyze the cause of these performance issues in detail and then design MuSher, an agile MPTCP scheduler that allows MPTCP to fully utilize the channel resources available to both interfaces. Our evaluation in realistic scenarios shows that MuSher provides a throughput improvement of up to 1.5x/2.3x and speeds up the recovery of a traffic stream, after disruption, by a factor of up to 8x/75x, under WLAN/Internet settings respectively, compared to the default MPTCP scheduler.",

We propose CellBricks, a novel cellular architecture that lowers the barrier to entry for new operators by enabling users to consume access on-demand from any available cellular operator \u2014 small or large, trusted or untrusted. CellBricks achieves this by moving support for mobility and user management (authentication and billing) out of the network and into end hosts. These changes, we believe, bring valuable benefits beyond enabling competition: they lead to a cellular infrastructure that is simpler and more efficient.We design, build, and evaluate CellBricks, showing that its benefits come at little-to-no cost in performance, with application performance overhead between -1.6% to 3.1% of that achieved by current cellular infrastructure.",

In this paper, we present TinyLink, a holistic system for rapid development of IoT applications. The key idea of TinyLink is to use a top-down approach for designing both the hardware and the software of IoT applications. Developers write the application code in a C-like language to specify the key logic of their applications, without dealing with the details of the specific hardware components. Taking the application code as input, TinyLink automatically generates the hardware configuration as well as the binary program executable on the target hardware platform. TinyLink provides unified APIs for applications to interact with the underlying hardware components. We implement TinyLink and evaluate its performance using real-world IoT applications. Results show that: (1) TinyLink achieves rapid development of IoT applications, reducing 52.58% of lines of code in average compared with traditional approaches; (2) TinyLink searches a much larger design space and thus can generate a superior solution for the hardware configuration, compared with the state-of-the-art approach; (3) TinyLink incurs acceptable overhead in terms of execution time and program memory.",

However, because of the inherent difficulties in collecting, processing and analyzing the data, it is difficult to obtain large data sets for study. In this work we present a system for detecting stationary interactions inside crowds, depending entirely on the sensors available in a modern smartphone device such as Bluetooth Smart (BLE) and Accelerometer. By utilizing Apple's iBeaconTM implementation of Bluetooth Smart using SensingKit1, our open-source multi-platform mobile sensing framework [1], we are able to detect the proximity of users carrying a smartphone in their pocket. We then use an algorithm based on graph theory to predict group interactions inside the crowd. Previous work in this area has been limited to the detection of interactions between only two people and therefore our approach goes beyond current state of the art in its ability to detect group formations with more than two people involved. Our approach is particularly beneficial to the design and implementation of crowd behavior analytics, design of influence strategies, and algorithms for crowd reconfiguration.",

CEIVE is a victim callee only solution without requiring additional infrastructure support or changes on telephony systems; It is ready to deploy and easy to use. Given an incoming call, CEIVE leverages a callback session and its associated call signaling observed at the phone to infer the call state of the other party. It further compares with the anticipated call state of the incoming call, thus quickly verifying whether the incoming call comes from the originating number or not. In this demo, we demonstrate CEIVE installed on Android phones combating both basic and advanced caller ID spoofing attacks.",

Tolerating failures when they occur along chains is imperative to the availability and reliability of enterprise applications. Making a chain fault-tolerant is challenging since, in the event of failures, the state of faulty middleboxes must be correctly and quickly recovered while providing high throughput and low latency.In this paper, we introduce FTC, a system design and protocol for fault-tolerant service function chaining. FTC provides strong consistency with up to f middlebox failures for chains of length f + 1 or longer without requiring dedicated replica nodes. In FTC, state updates caused by packet processing at a middlebox are collected, piggybacked onto the packet, and sent along the chain to be replicated. Our evaluation shows that compared with the state of art [51], FTC improves throughput by 2-3.5X for a chain of two to five middleboxes.",

Machine learning is one of the promising approaches to discriminate the malicious applications from the benign ones. Despite its higher malware detection capability, a significant challenge remains: in adversarial environment, an attacker can adapt by maximally sabotaging classifiers by polluting training data. This paper proposes KuafuDet, a two-phase learning enhancing approach that adversarially detects the Android malware. Experiments on more than 50,000 Android applications demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.",

Most existing VLP approaches require special designed light or receiver, collecting light information or strict user operation (e.g., horizontally holding mobile phone). This incurs a high deployment, maintenance and usage overhead. We present RainbowLight, a low cost ambient light 3D localization approach easy to deploy in today's buildings. Our key finding is that light through a chip of polarizer and birefringence material produces specific interference and light spectrum at different directions to the chip. We derive a model to characterize the relation for direction, light interference and spectrum. Exploiting the model, RainbowLight calculates the direction to a chip after taking a photo containing the chip. With multiple chips, RainbowLight designs a direction intersection based method to derive the location. We implement RainbowLight and extensively evaluate its performance in various environments. The evaluation results show that RainbowLight achieves an average localization error of 3.3 cm in 2D and 9.6 cm in 3D for light on, and an error of 7.4 cm in 2D and 20.5 cm in 3D for light off scenario in daytime.",

In the meantime, more and more mobile workloads and optimizations now rely on the cloud, such as mobile cloud offloading, cloud-based mobile web optimization, and cloud-based network traffic redundancy reduction. However, it is hard to perform large-scale and personalized support or optimization for mobile workloads without significant computation resource increase on the cloud, as well as higher bandwidth requirement on the networks. We target solving the above two problems by enabling edge-hosed personalized services (EPS for short). The idea of EPS is twofold. One is enabling developer-customizable and power-and-traffic-efficient network communication on the \"last-hop\" communication between mobile devices and the network edge. The other is distributing cloud services for mobile workloads to network edge, so that they can be done on a personalized basis, while enjoying much lower communication latency to/from mobile devices.",

One challenge here is predicting catchments. A na\\\"{\\i}ve approach is to advertise the prefix from all subsets of available sites and choose the best-performing subset, but this does not scale well. We demonstrate that by conducting pairwise experiments between sites peering with tier-1 networks, we can predict the catchments that would result if we announce to any subset of the sites. We prove that our method is effective in a simplified model of BGP, consistent with common BGP routing policies, and evaluate it in a real-world testbed. We then present AnyOpt, a system that predicts anycast catchments. Using AnyOpt, a network operator can find a subset of anycast sites that minimizes client latency without using the na\\\"{\\i}ve approach. In an experiment using 15 sites, each peering with one of six transit providers, AnyOpt predicted site catchments of 15,300 clients with 94.7% accuracy and client RTTs with a mean error of 4.6%. AnyOpt identified a subset of 12 sites, announcing to which lowers the mean RTT to clients by 33ms compared to a greedy approach that enables the same number of sites with the lowest average unicast latency.",

The service allows the bikes to be dropped off freely, and to be found through GPS localization. For maximum convenience, the bikes are often parked in close proximity to the buildings, where GPS may perform poorly, making bike search a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to addressing this problem. Inspired by multi-antenna systems, our method tries to collect GPS signals from multiple distributed bikes, by organizing a group of bikes into a network, called the BikeGPS. Formed by pedestrian users who opportunistically measure interbike distance via radio sensing and step tracking, the generated network permits one to map all the nodes' satellite range measurements into a single lead node's view. By considering both signal and geometry properties of satellite raw measurements, and using an asynchronous coarse time navigation algorithm, the lead node can accurately derive the locations of all the network nodes. Real-world experiments show that BikeGPS significantly improves the localization performance, in terms of both accuracy and solution availability, compared with the naive GPS approach and a high-level cooperative localization method.",

We find that performance potentials are missed in today's mobile networks, as the data speed a user device gets is much lower than what the device could get. The issue is rooted in the current cell selection practice, which misses good candidate cells that offer faster access speed, thus under-utilizing the available capabilities in mobile networks. We design iCellSpeed to facilitate network-controlled cell selection with proactive device-side assistance towards more desirable cells. Our evaluation over AT&amp;T and Verizon confirms its effectiveness. iCellSpeed increases data access speed by more than 10 Mbps at 79% of test locations (&gt; 25Mbps at 29% of locations, up to 80.6 Mbps). It doubles access speed at 62.5% of locations with the gain up to 28.4x. Datasets are available at [9].",

Published research has typically presented results from short controlled experiments on one system. In this paper, we deploy an extensive real-world comparative human subject study. We observe twenty patients during their overnight sleep (a total of 160 hours), during which contact sensors record ground-truth breathing data, patient position is recorded, and four different RF breathing monitoring systems simultaneously record measurements. We evaluate published methods and algorithms. We find that WiFi channel state information measurements provide the most robust respiratory rate estimates of the four RF systems tested. However, all four RF systems have periods during which RF-based breathing estimates are not reliable.",

In this paper, we present BiPass to break this limitation.With the help of full duplex capable relays, weenable simultaneous bidirectional in-band cut-through transmissions between two far apart nodes, so they can do full duplex communications as if they were within each other's transmission range.To design such a system, we analyze interference patterns and propose a loop-back interference cancellation strategy. We identify the power amplification problem at relay nodes and develop an algorithm to solve it. We also develop a routing algorithm, an opportunistic forwarding scheme, and a real-time feedback strategy to leverage this system in ad-hoc networks.To evaluate the real world performance of BiPass, we build a prototype and conduct experiments using software defined radios. We show that BiPass can achieve 1.6x median throughput gain over state-of-the-art one-way cut-through systems, and 4.09x gain over the decode-and-forward scheme. Our simulations further reveal that even when the data traffic is not bidirectional, BiPass has 1.36x throughput gain and 47% delay reduction overone-way cut-through systemsin large networks.",

                    "abstract": "App links, also known as mobile deep links, are URIs that point to specific pages in an app. App links are essential to many mobile experiences: Google and Bing use them to link search results directly to relevant pages in an app and apps use them for cross-app navigation. However, app links are hard to discover and, since they must be explicitly built into apps by developers, only exist for a small fraction of apps. To address these two problems, we propose Elix, an automated app link extractor. We define link extraction as a static information flow problem where a link, with its scheme and parameters, is synthesized by analyzing the data flow between subsequent pages in an app. As static analysis is prone to false positives, Elix adopts a novel, path-selective taint analysis that leverages symbolic execution to reason about path constraints and abandon infeasible paths. Elix can automatically and correctly discover links that are exposed by an app, and many others that are not explicitly exposed, thus increasing coverage of both link-enabled apps and link-enabled pages in an app. Elix also simplifies the scheme of extracted links by reducing complex types to a minimal set of primitive types. We have implemented Elix on Android and applied it to 1007 popular Android apps. Elix can extract 80-90% of an app's links, and above 80% of the extracted links are stable.",

This work focuses on the last leg of such delivery: physically approaching a customer's landing zone. This has traditionally relied on a combination of GPS and computer-vision to locate and identify a landing zone. Instead of using computer vision, we propose to use ultra-wideband beacons (UWB) to assist in the landing process. The UAV's location relative to the landing zone is continuously measured based on the wireless propagation delay between the UAV and the landing zone's corners. We show that a single pair of wireless devices, one at the UAV and one at the landing zone, suffices to obtain the UAV's location. The landing zone's UWB device, connected to multiple antennas, receives multiple copies of the UAV's signals, that enables a sub-decimeter 3D-localization of the UAV. This helps the UAV's control logic governing the approach and landing process.",

In such application domains, it is essential to keep information fresh, as outdated information loses its value and can lead to system failures and safety risks. The Age of Information (AoI) is a performance metric that captures how fresh the information is from the perspective of the destination. In this paper, we show that as the congestion in the wireless network increases, the AoI degrades sharply, leading to outdated information at the destination. Leveraging years of theoretical research, we propose and implement WiFresh: an unconventional architecture that achieves near optimal information freshness in wireless networks, regardless of the level of congestion. Our experimental results show that WiFresh can improve information freshness by two orders of magnitude when compared to an equivalent standard WiFi network.",

In Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LP-WANs), this one-to-one design paradigm is often overly pessimistic in terms of link budget because client packets are frequently detected by multiple gateways (i.e. one-to-many). Prior work has shown massive improvement in performance when specialized hardware is used to coherently combine signals at the physical layer.In this paper, we explore the potential of using multiple receivers at the MAC and link layer where these performance gains are often neglected. We present an approach called Opportunistic Packet Recovery (OPR) that targets the most likely corrupt bits across a set of packets that suffered failed CRCs at multiple LoRa LP-WAN base-stations. We see that bit errors are often disjoint across receivers, which aids in collaborative error detection. OPR leverages this to provide increasing gain in error recovery as a function of the number of receiving gateways. Since LP-WAN networks can easily offload packet processing to the cloud, there is ample compute time per packet (order of seconds) to search for bit permutations that would restore packet integrity. Link layer corrections have the advantage of being immediately applicable to the millions of already deployed LP-WAN systems without additional hardware or expensive RF front-ends. We experimentally demonstrate that OPR can correct up to 72% of packets that would normally have failed, when they are captured by multiple gateways.",

We therefore argue for fine-grained mobile endpoint-based wireless measurements to inform a precise congestion control algorithm through a well-defined API to the mobile's cellular physical layer. Our proposed congestion control algorithm is based on Physical-Layer Bandwidth measurements taken at the Endpoint (PBE-CC), and captures the latest 5G New Radio innovations that increase wireless capacity, yet create abrupt rises and falls in available wireless capacity that the PBE-CC sender can react to precisely and rapidly. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype of the PBE measurement module on software-defined radios and the PBE sender and receiver in C. An extensive performance evaluation compares PBE-CC head to head against the cellular-aware and wireless-oblivious congestion control protocols proposed in the research community and in deployment, in mobile and static mobile scenarios, and over busy and idle networks. Results show 6.3% higher average throughput than BBR, while simultaneously reducing 95th percentile delay by 1.8x.",

Network slicing has profound implications on resource management, as it entails an inherent trade-off between: (i) the need for fully dedicated resources to support service customization, and (ii) the dynamic resource sharing among services to increase resource efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the system. In this paper, we provide a first investigation of this trade-off via an empirical study of resource management efficiency in network slicing. Building on substantial measurement data collected in an operational mobile network (i) we quantify the efficiency gap introduced by non-reconfigurable allocation strategies of different kinds of resources, from radio access to the core of the network, and (ii) we quantify the advantages of their dynamic orchestration at different timescales. Our results provide insights on the achievable efficiency of network slicing architectures, their dimensioning, and their interplay with resource management algorithms.",

In this demo, we propose the first SmartWatch-based American sign language (ASL) recognition system, which is more comfortable, portable and user-friendly and offers accessibility anytime, anywhere. This system is based on the intuitive idea that each sign has its specific motion pattern which can be transformed into unique gyroscope and accelerometer signals and then analyzed and learned by using Long-Short term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) trained with connectionist temporal classification (CTC). In this way, signs and context information can be correctly recognized based on an off-the-shelf device (eg. SmartWatch, Smartphone). The experiments show that, in the Known user split task, our system reaches an average word error rate of 7.29% to recognize 73 sentences formed by 103 ASL signs and achieves detection ratio up to 93.7% for a single sign. The result also shows our system has a good adaptation, even including new users, it can achieve an average word error rate of 21.6% at the sentence level and reach an average detection ratio of 79.4%. Moreover, our system performs real time ASL translation, outputting the speech within 1.69 seconds for a sentence of 12 signs in average.",

                    "abstract": "Recent developed application-level virtualization brings a groundbreaking innovation to Android ecosystem: a host app is able to load and launch arbitrary guest APK files without the hassle of installation. Powered by this technology, the so-called \"dual-instance apps\" are becoming increasingly popular as they can run dual copies of the same app on a single device (e.g., login Facebook simultaneously with two different accounts). Given the large demand from smartphone users, it is imperative to understand how secure dual-instance apps are. However, little work investigates their potential security risks. Even worse, new Android malware variants have been accused of skimming the cream off application-level virtualization. They abuse legitimate virtualization engines to launch phishing attacks or even thwart static detection. We first demonstrate that, current dual-instance apps design introduces serious \"shared-everything\" threats to users, and severe attacks such as permission escalation and privacy leak have become tremendously easier. Unfortunately, we find that most critical apps cannot discriminate between host app and Android system. In addition, traditional fingerprinting features targeting Android sandboxes are futile as well. To inform users that an app is running in an untrusted environment, we study the inherent features of dual-instance app environment and propose six robust fingerprinting features to detect whether an app is being launched by the host app. We test our approach, called DiPrint, with a set of dual-instance apps collected from popular app stores, Android systems, and virtualization-based malware.

In the process, they waste their energy and airtime, which affects their battery-life and throughput. We present Elixir, a protocol for WiFi-based IoT nodes that enables them to transmit data without the need of a WiFi association. Elixir is implemented in the user space, which makes it easy to port the implementation to any Linux-based client and AP. We demonstrate its end-to-end operation on a Raspberry Pi module in good [signal strengths '40 to '50 dBm and no losses] and bad network conditions [signal strengths below '80 dBm and losses present]. We measure benefits of Elixir in terms of (a) the ability to transmit when the WiFi association cannot be maintained [in bad network condition], (b) lesser number of frames transmitted [50x - good network condition, 100x\u202f? bad network condition], (c) reduced airtime consumption [10x - bad network condition], and (d) reduced battery expenditure [18% for both network conditions].",

Phase is a crucial physical feature for many RFID sensing applications, such as tag localization. Most existing methods rely on a low multipath environment for accurate phase measurement. Unfortunately, practical environments are highly likely to be multipath-revalent, especially for indoors. This paper presents the first work to extract \"clean\" phase measurement of RFID tags in multipath-prevalent environments. We propose CPEX (Clean Phase EXtraction) based on theoretical modeling, which is also validated via experimental results of our prototype implementation. We studied the performance of CPEX on tag localization. CPEX can achieve median errors of 4.3-6.4cm (in different setups), which is the most accurate 3D tag localization result in multipath-prevalent environments.",

Vision or acoustic-based techniques are vulnerable against challenging lighting conditions or background noise, while more robust laser or RF solutions require either bulky expensive hardware or tight coordination between multiple devices. This paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of Ulysses, a practical environmental imaging system using colocated 60GHz radios on a single mobile device. Unlike alternatives that require specialized hardware, Ulysses reuses low-cost commodity networking chipsets available today. Ulysses' new imaging approach leverages RF beamforming, operates on specular (direct) reflection, and integrates the device's movement trajectory with sensing. Ulysses also includes a navigation component that uses the same 60GHz radios to compute \"safety regions\" where devices can move freely without collision, and to compute optimal paths for imaging within safety regions. Using our implementation of a small robotic car prototype, our experimental results show that Ulysses images objects meters away with cm-level precision, and provides accurate estimates of objects' surface materials.",

The key observation is that the raw phase measurements even measured form different RFID tags contain a same set of unknown phase errors. With enough tags' phase measurements, we can determine all the unknown phase errors, since the number of known phase measurements is much larger than the number of unknown phase errors. Real-world experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

                    "abstract": "The growing diversification of mobile services imposes requirements on network performance that are ever more stringent and heterogeneous. Network slicing aligns mobile network operation to this context, by enabling operators to isolate and customize network resources on a per-service basis. A key input for provisioning resources to slices is real-time information about the traffic demands generated by individual services. Acquiring such knowledge is however challenging, as legacy approaches based on in-depth inspection of traffic streams have high computational costs, which inflate with the widening adoption of encryption over data and control traffic. In this paper, we present a new approach to service-level demand estimation for slicing, which hinges on decomposition, i.e., the inference of per-service demands from traffic aggregates. By operating on total traffic volumes only, our approach overcomes the complexity and limitations of legacy traffic classification techniques, and provides a suitable input to recent 'Network Slice as a Service' (NSaaS) models. We implement decomposition through Microscope, a novel framework that uses deep learning to infer individual service demands from complex spatiotemporal features hidden in traffic aggregates. Microscope (i) transforms traffic data collected in irregular radio access deployments in a format suitable for convolutional learning, and (ii) can accommodate a variety of neural network architectures, including original 3D Deformable Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-DefCNNs) that we explicitly design for decomposition. Experiments with measurement data collected in an operational network demonstrate that Microscope accurately estimates per-service traffic demands with relative errors below 1.2%. Further, tests in practical NSaaS management use cases show that resource allocations informed by decomposition yield affordable costs for the mobile network operator.",

We explore the uniqueness of the human cardiac system captured by the PPG sensing technology. Existing CA systems require either the dedicated sensing hardware or specific gestures, whereas our system does not require any users' interactions but only the wearable device, which has already been pervasively equipped with PPG sensors. Notably, we design a robust motion artifacts (MA) removal method to mitigate the impact of MA from wrist movements. Additionally, we explore the characteristic fiducial features from PPG measurements to efficiently distinguish the human cardiac system. Furthermore, we develop a cardiac-based classifier for user identification using the Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT). Experiments with the prototype of the wrist-worn PPG sensing platform and 10 participants in different scenarios demonstrate that our system can effectively remove MA and achieve a high average authentication success rate over $90%$.",

While voice-based interface is intuitive, it is insufficient in many scenarios, such as in noisy or quiet environments, for users with language barriers, or in applications that require continuous motion tracking. Motion-based control is attractive and complementary to existing voice-based control. However, accurate and reliable room-scale motion tracking poses a significant challenge due to low SNR, interference, and varying mobility. To this end, we develop a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) based system that uses speakers and microphones to realize accurate room-scale tracking. Our system jointly estimates the propagation distance and angle-of-arrival (AoA) of signals reflected by the hand, based on AoA-distance profiles generated by 2D MUSIC. We design a series of techniques to significantly enhance the profile quality under low SNR. We feed the profiles in a recent history to our RNN to estimate the distance and AoA. In this way, we can exploit the temporal structure among consecutive profiles to remove the impact of noise, interference and mobility. Using extensive evaluation, we show our system achieves 1.2--3.7~cm error within 4.5~m range, supports tracking multiple users, and is robust against ambient sound. To our knowledge, this is the first acoustic device-free room-scale tracking system.",

By fostering an explicit and deep integration of the end-user directly into the design, analysis and management of large-scale operational networks, we expect to reduce the gap between QoE research and its application to future network management paradigms, as well as to provide a more targeted end-user perspective to the research on distributed communication systems. The 4th edition of Internet-QoE also focuses on novel end-user services enabled by next generation technologies such as immersive media (3D, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality), self-driving cars, intelligent manufacturing systems, Industry 4.0 and tactile Internet, 5G ultra-low-latency mobile networks, and real-time applications.",

Analysis of the resulting dataset poses unique challenges; methods in the status quo are tailored for specific spectrum-related applications (apps), and are ill equipped to process data of this magnitude. In this paper, we design BigSpec, a general-purpose framework that allows for fast processing of apps. The key idea is to reduce computation costs by performing computation extensively on compressed data that preserves signal features. Adhering to this guideline, we build solutions for three apps, i.e., energy detection, spatio-temporal spectrum estimation, and anomaly detection. These apps were chosen to highlight BigSpec's efficiency, scalability, and extensibility. To evaluate BigSpec's performance, we collect more than 1 terabyte of spectrum data spanning a year, across 300MHz-4GHz, covering 400 km2. Compared with baselines and prior works, we achieve 17\\texttimes{} run time efficiency, sublinear rather than linear run time scalability, and extend the definition of anomaly to different domains (frequency &amp; spatio-temporal). We also obtain high-level insights from the data to provide valuable advice on future spectrum measurement and data analysis.",

In this paper, we introduce MIMO smoothing as a new technique to bring decorrelation effect by leveraging the spacial and frequential diversity in MIMO transmitters and receivers. Via extensive experiments on WiFi links, we show that MIMO smoothing can increase the accuracy of multipath resolution.",

Through in-depth observations and understandings, we reveal that existing congestion detection mechanisms in mainstream lossless networks (i.e., Converged Enhanced Ethernet and InfiniBand) are improper, due to failing to cognize the interaction between hop-by-hop flow controls and congestion detection behaviors in switches. We define ternary states of switch ports and present Ternary Congestion Detection (TCD) for mainstream lossless networks. Testbed and extensive simulations demonstrate that TCD can detect congestion ports accurately and identify flows contributing to congestion as well as flows only affected by hop-by-hop flow controls. Meanwhile, we shed light on how to incorporate TCD with rate control. Case studies show that existing congestion control algorithms can achieve 3.3x and 2.0x better median and 99th-percentile FCT slowdown by combining with TCD.",

However, the cumulative increase of mobile terminals and emerging cloud applications, poses new challenges for edge networks. To combat this issue, the promising idea of mobile micro-clouds (MMCs) is proposed to enhance edges and the cloud. In this paper, we investigate the problem of virtual cluster (VC) placement in MMCs, to minimize the average response latency with various requests among multiple cloud applications. Then a hybrid swarm intelligence approach is proposed to optimize VC placement scheme, for a trade-off between the average response latency and the overall VC placement cost.

                    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has been a popular method to achieve distributed machine learning among numerous devices without sharing their data to a cloud server. FL aims to learn a shared global model with the participation of massive devices under the orchestration of a central server. However, mobile devices usually have limited communication bandwidth to transfer local updates to the central server. In addition, the data residing across devices is intrinsically statistically heterogeneous (i.e., non-IID data distribution). Learning a single global model may not work well for all devices participating in the FL under data heterogeneity. Such communication cost and data heterogeneity are two critical bottlenecks that hinder from applying FL in practice. Moreover, mobile devices usually have limited computational resources. Improving the inference efficiency of the learned model is critical to deploy deep learning applications on mobile devices. In this paper, we present Hermes - a communication and inference-efficient FL framework under data heterogeneity. To this end, each device finds a small subnetwork by applying the structured pruning; only the updates of these subnetworks will be communicated between the server and the devices. Instead of taking the average over all parameters of all devices as conventional FL frameworks, the server performs the average on only overlapped parameters across each subnetwork. By applying Hermes, each device can learn a personalized and structured sparse deep neural network, which can run efficiently on devices. Experiment results show the remarkable advantages of Hermes over the status quo approaches. Hermes achieves as high as 32.17% increase in inference accuracy, 3.48\\texttimes{} reduction on the communication cost, 1.83\\texttimes{} speedup in inference efficiency, and 1.8\\texttimes{} savings on energy consumption.",

State-of-the-art backscatter WiFi solutions have seldom explored advanced features in the latest WiFi standards, in particular, spatial multiplexing, which has been the cornerstone for 802.11n and beyond. In this paper, we present MOXcatter, a WiFi backscatter communication system that works with spatial streams using commodity radios, while keeping the ongoing data communication unaffected. In MOXcatter, a backscatter tag can embed its sensing data on ambient spatial-stream packets, and both the sensing data and the original packets can be decoded by commodity WiFi devices. We have built a MOXcatter prototype with FPGAs and commodity WiFi devices. The experiments show that MOXcatter achieves up to 50 Kbps throughput for a single stream and up to 1 Kbps for double streams with a communication range (tag-to-RX) up to 14 m. We discuss the tradeoffs therein and possible enhancements, and also showcase the applicability of our design through a sensor communication system.",

In this paper, we explore an array of phased arrays (APA) architecture, which aggregates co-located phased arrays with complementary FoVs to approximate WiFi-like omni-directional coverage. We found that straightforwardly activating all the arrays may even hamper network performance. To fully exploit the APA's potential, we propose X-Array, which jointly selects the arrays and beams, and applies a dynamic co-phasing mechanism to ensure different arrays' signals enhance each other. X-Array also incorporates a link recovery mechanism to identify alternative arrays/beams that can efficiently recover the link from outage. We have implemented X-Array on a commodity 802.11ad APA radio. Our experiments demonstrate that X-Array can approach omni-directional coverage and maintain high performance in spite of link dynamics.",

To support its diverse operating conditions, a set of different OFDM numerologies has been defined in the standards body. Under this numerology, it is necessary to perform scheduling with a time resolution of \u223c100 \u03bcs. This requirement poses a new challenge that does not exist in LTE and cannot be supported by any existing LTE schedulers. In this paper, we present the design of GPF -- a GPU-based proportional fair (PF) scheduler that can meet the \u223c100 \u03bcs time requirement. The key ideas include decomposing the scheduling problem into a large number of small and independent sub-problems and selecting a subset of sub-problems from the most promising search space to fit into a GPU. By implementing GPF on an off-the-shelf Nvidia Quadro P6000 GPU, we show that GPF is able to achieve near-optimal performance while meeting the \u223c100 $mathrm\u03bcs time requirement. GPF represents the first successful design of a GPU-based PF scheduler that can meet the new time requirement in NR.",

In this work, we examine the LTE testing practices in terms of completeness and efficiency. We discover that the standardized tests are incomplete in that a number of test cases related to multiple protocol interactions are missing. Our analysis also shows that, the isolated treatment of test cases, but not from the system perspective, incurs repetitive executions of test operations, thus resulting in testing inefficiencies. We thus make a case for a paradigm shift from ad hoc testing to a methodical approach to LTE testing. We follow a few guidelines from the LTE standards and propose an algorithmic approach to systematic testing. In the process, we address various challenges, provide complete list of test cases, and present the related algorithms. Our evaluation shows that, by eliminating repetitive operations, our new scheme reduces up to 70% of LTE testing steps. We also find 87 new, yet valid test cases that are not defined by the LTE standards.",

The main advantage of WiFi backscatter technologies over RFID is that data from their tags can be read using existing WiFi infrastructures instead of specialized readers. This can potentially reduce the complexity and cost of deploying battery-free sensors. Despite extensive work in this area, none of the existing systems are in widespread use today. We hypothesize that this is because WiFi-based backscatter tags do not scale well and their range and capabilities are limited when compared with RFID. To test this hypothesis we conduct several real-world experiments.We compare WiFi backscatter and RFID technologies in terms of RF harvesting capabilities, throughput, range and scalability. Our results show that existing WiFi backscatter tags cannot rely on RF harvesting (as opposed to RFID tags) due to their high power consumption. We find that WiFi backscatter tags must be quite close to a WiFi device to work robustly in non-line-of-sight scenarios, limiting their operating range. Furthermore, our results show that some WiFi backscatter systems can cause significant interference for existing WiFi traffic and be affected by them since they do not perform carrier sensing.",

                    "abstract": "Federated learning was proposed with an intriguing vision of achieving collaborative machine learning among numerous clients without uploading their private data to a cloud server. However, the conventional framework requires each client to leverage the full model for learning, which can be prohibitively inefficient for large-scale learning tasks and resource-constrained mobile devices. Thus, we proposed a submodel framework, where clients download only the needed parts of the full model, namely, submodels, and then upload the submodel updates. Nevertheless, the \"position\" of a client's truly required submodel corresponds to its private data, while the disclosure of the true position to the cloud server during interactions inevitably breaks the tenet of federated learning. To integrate efficiency and privacy, we designed a secure federated submodel learning scheme coupled with a private set union protocol as a cornerstone. The secure scheme features the properties of randomized response, secure aggregation, and Bloom filter, and endows each client with customized plausible deniability (in terms of local differential privacy) against the position of its desired submodel, thereby protecting private data. We further instantiated the scheme with Alibaba's e-commerce recommendation, implemented a prototype system, and extensively evaluated over 30-day Taobao user data. Empirical results demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of the proposed scheme as well as its remarkable advantages over the conventional federated learning framework, from model accuracy and convergency, practical communication, computation, and storage overhead.",

We present M2, a system for multi-mobile computing that enables existing unmodified mobile apps to share and combine multiple devices, including cameras, displays, speakers, microphones, sensors, GPS, and input. M2 introduces a new data-centric approach that leverages higher-level device abstractions and hardware acceleration to efficiently share device data, not API calls. To support heterogeneous devices, M2 introduces device transformation, a new technique to mix and match different types of devices. Example transformations include combining multiple displays into a single larger display for better viewing, or substituting accelerometer for touchscreen input to provide a Nintendo Wii-like experience with existing mobile gaming apps. We have implemented M2 and show that it (1) operates across heterogeneous systems, including multiple versions of Android and iOS, (2) can enable unmodified Android apps to use multiple mobile devices in new and powerful ways, including supporting users with disabilities and better audio conferencing, and (3) can run apps across mobile systems with modest overhead and qualitative performance indistinguishable from using local device hardware.",

It enables nodes to steer their antennas in the direction of communication. To cope with complexity and overhead, the IEEE 802.11ad standard uses a sector codebook with distinct steering directions. In current off-the-shelf devices, we find codebooks with generic pre-defined beam patterns. While this approach is simple and robust, the antenna modules that are typically deployed in such devices are capable of generating much more precise antenna beams. In this paper, we adaptively adjust the sector codebook of IEEE 802.11ad devices to optimize the transmit beam patterns for the current channel. To achieve this, we propose a mechanism to extract full channel state information (CSI) regarding phase and magnitude from coarse signal strength readings on off-the-shelf IEEE 802.11ad devices. Since such devices do not expose the CSI directly, we generate a codebook with phase-shifted probing beams that enables us to obtain the CSI by combining strategically selected magnitude measurements. Using this CSI, transmitters dynamically compute a transmit beam pattern that maximizes the signal strength at the receiver. Thereby, we automatically exploit reflectors in the environment and improve the received signal quality. Our implementation of this mechanism on off-the-shelf devices demonstrates that adaptive codebook optimization achieves a significantly higher throughput of about a factor of two in typical real-world scenarios.",

It allows app developers to focus their effort on app logic and helps the developers of data management solutions to achieve wider deployability. It also gives increased control of data management to end users and allows them to use different solutions for different apps. We present a prototype implementation of our design called BlueMountain, and implement several data management solutions for file and database management to demonstrate the utility and ease of using our design. We perform detailed microbenchmarks as well as end-to-end measurements for files and databases to demonstrate the performance overhead incurred by our implementation.",

Wi-Cache is motivated by the belief that edge caching technologies are needed to augment emerging network technologies to meet the increasing (volume, quality, and variety) demand for content, which is itself changing its characteristics significantly. Wi-Cache is being used to test new ideas for edge caching. Specifically, Wi-Cache is a framework for edge caching which allows caching and delivery of content on WiFi APs. Apart from a network induced handoff of clients, it allows communication between the APs for content delivery. We have also developed an API that is exposed for implementation of algorithms for content delivery and placement, and cache replacement.",

However, we found that a number of serious outliers in the real-world data may adversely affect predictions.

Due to their energy constraints, wireless sensors today communicate occasional short samples or pre-determined summary statistics of the data they collect. This means that computing every additional statistic at high fidelity incurs additional communication and energy overhead. This paper presents Joltik, a framework enabling general, future-proof, and energy-efficient analytics for low power wireless sensors. Joltik is general in that it summarizes sensed data from low-power devices without making assumptions on which specific statistical metric(s) are desired at the cloud and is future-proof, meaning it supports new, unforeseen metrics. Joltik is built upon recent theoretical advances in universal sketching, which can enable a Joltik sensor node to report a compact summary of observed data to enable a large class of statistical summaries. We address key system design and implementation challenges with respect to communication, memory, and computation bottlenecks that arise in practically realizing the potential benefits of universal sketching in the low-power regime. We present a proof-of-concept testbed evaluation of Joltik in LoRaWAN NUCLEO-L476RG boards and sensors. Across a range of realistic datasets, Joltik provides up to a 24.6\\texttimes{} reduction in energy cost compared to transmitting raw data and outperforms many natural alternatives (e.g., sub-sampling, custom sketches, compressed sensing, and lossy compression) in terms of energy-accuracy trade-offs.",

                    "abstract": "Inertial sensors continuously track the 3D orientation of a flying drone, serving as the bedrock for maneuvers and stabilization. However, even the best inertial measurement units (IMU) are prone to various types of correlated failures. We consider using multiple GPS receivers on the drone as a fail-safe mechanism for IMU failures. The core challenge is in accurately computing the relative locations between each receiver pair, and translating these measurements into the drone's 3D orientation. Achieving IMU-like orientation requires the relative GPS distances to be accurate to a few centimeters -- a difficult task given that GPS today is only accurate to around 1-4 meters. Moreover, GPS-based orientation needs to be precise even under sharp drone maneuvers, GPS signal blockage, and sudden bouts of missing data. This paper designs SafetyNet, an off-the-shelf GPS-only system that addresses these challenges through a series of techniques, culminating in a novel particle filter framework running over multi-GNSS systems (GPS, GLONASS, and SBAS). Results from 11 sessions of 5-7 minute flights report median orientation accuracies of 2\u00b0 even under overcast weather conditions. Of course, these improvements arise from an increase in cost due to the multiple GPS receivers, however, when safety is of interest, we believe that tradeoff is worthwhile.",

The continuous monitoring of ECG can help diagnose cardiac disorders, such as arrhythmia, effectively. While many wearable healthcare platforms offer continuous ECG monitoring, these devices are cumbersome in the fact that they need to be continuously attached to the human body, which causes uncomfortableness, and limits their usage when monitoring a person's ECG throughout the night as they sleep. In this work, we propose a fully non-intrusive sensing system for monitoring the ECG of a person while in bed. Specifically, we present Heartquake, a geophone-based sensing system for extracting ECG patterns using heartbeat vibrations that penetrate through the mattress. The cardiac activity-originated vibration patterns are captured on the geophone and sent to a server, where the data is filtered to remove external noise and passed on to a bidirectional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM) deep learning model for ECG waveform extraction. Our experimental results with 21study participants suggest that Heartquake can detect all five ECG peaks (e.g., P, Q, R, S, T) with an average error of as low as 16 msec when participants are stationary on the bed. With additional noise factors, this error shows an increase, but can be mitigated from model personalization to still be sufficient enough as a screening tool to detect urgent situations.",

                    "abstract": "\"Hands on the wheel, eyes on the road\" is the central guideline of safe vehicle driving practices. Many advanced driver assistance systems can effectively detect abnormal vehicle motions. However, these systems often leave insufficient time for drivers to respond to complex road situations, especially when the drivers are distracted. To reduce accidents, it is essential to detect whether a driver complies with safe driving guidelines in real time and provide warnings early before any dangerous maneuvers occur. There are vision-based driver distraction monitoring systems which rely on cameras in high-end vehicles, but their performances are heavily constrained by visibility requirements. In this paper, we present MagTrack, a driver monitoring system that is based on tracking magnetic tags worn by the user. With a single smartwatch and two low-cost magnetic accessories: a hand magnetic ring and a head magnetic eyeglasses clip, our system tracks and classifies a driver's bimanual and head movements simultaneously using both analytical and approximation sensing models. Our approach is robust to driver's postures, vehicles, and environmental changes. We demonstrate that a wide range of activities can be detected by our system, including bimanual steering, visual and manual distractions, and lane changes and turns. In extensive road tests with 500+ instances of driving activities and 500+ minutes of road driving with 10 subjects, MagTrack achieves 87% of precision and 90% of recall rate on the detection of unsafe driving activities.",

Smartphones localize themselves using GPS position estimates, and augment these with a variety of techniques including dead reckoning, map matching, and WiFi localization. However, GPS signals suffer significant impairment in urban canyons because of limited line-of-sight to satellites and signal reflections. In this paper, we focus on scalable and deployable techniques to reduce the impact of one specific impairment: reflected GPS signals from non-line-of-sight (NLOS) satellites. Specifically, we show how, using publicly available street-level imagery and off-the-shelf computer vision techniques, we can estimate the path inflation incurred by (the extra distance traveled by) a reflected signal from a satellite. Using these path inflation estimates we develop techniques to estimate the most likely actual position given a set of satellite readings at some position. Finally, we develop optimizations for fast position estimation on modern smartphones. Using extensive experiments in the downtown area of several large cities, we find that our techniques can reduce positioning error by up to 55% on average.",

Existing proposals either have no hardware implementations for switch ASICs or require multiple strict-priority queues.We present Admission-In First-Out (AIFO) queues, a new solution for programmable packet scheduling that uses only a emph{single} first-in first-out queue. AIFO is motivated by the confluence of two recent trends: emph{shallow} buffers in switches and emph{fast-converging} congestion control in end hosts, that together leads to a simple observation: the decisive factor in a flow's completion time (FCT) in modern datacenter networks is often emph{which} packets are enqueued or dropped, not the emph{ordering} they leave the switch. The core idea of AIFO is to maintain a sliding window to track the ranks of recent packets and compute the relative rank of an arriving packet in the window for admission control. Theoretically, we prove that AIFO provides bounded performance to Push-In First-Out (PIFO). Empirically, we fully implement AIFO and evaluate AIFO with a range of real workloads, demonstrating AIFO closely approximates PIFO.

It builds a community with multiple clients and a server, which aggregates the clients' local models into a federated model with cross-domain capability. To protect the privacy of users' local data, we innovatively introduce the idea of federated learning into the field of wireless sensing, by uploading users' local model parameters instead of their local data. Then, in response to the uneven computing power of different users' edge devices, we propose a local model update algorithm based on adaptive computing power. Furthermore, a client selection algorithm based on test nodes is designed to reduce the negative influence of malicious clients on Co-Sense. Finally, we evaluate Co-Sense on three well-known public wireless datasets, including the gesture dataset, the activity dataset, and the gait dataset. Experimental results show that the sensing accuracy of Co-Sense is more than 10% higher than that of the most advanced wireless sensing models.",

However, this personalization comes at a cost of privacy of sharing personal information with the recommendation provider. Moreover, with growing sizes of datasets and models, centralized processing of such data has become challenging. To this end, we propose a federated matrix factorization algorithm to enable personal data to be stored and used on-device for training while sending updates to train a centralized model. We illustrate preliminary results from our algorithm applied to recommendation of articles to users of a mobile application based on their reading history. We compare our performance with centralized matrix factorization applied on the same dataset.",

The tutorial begins by discussing the potential cost and performance advantages of creating ICs with OCAs. The design of ICs in which the antenna and conventional circuitry are all fabricated on the same substrate offers advantages in terms of size, weight and cost over conventional RFID/sensor systems in which an IC is assembled onto an antenna substrate; however, it is challenging because the limited size of the antenna set by the die size and its proximity to a resistive ground plane (the IC substrate) both decrease the RF energy that can be harvested to operate the on-chip circuitry. In this Tutorial, we will apply simplifying approximations in order to develop basic equations relating the size and geometry of the antennas to the ability of the OCA-IC to harvest ambient RF energy; and, we will validate those equations with electromagnetic field simulations. The tutorial will also examine the challenging issue of matching the antenna to the on-chip electronics in a way that maximizes the power that can be extracted from an external RF signal. The Tutorial will consider operation across a range of frequencies and will explore both in-plane spiral antennas and out-of-plane helical antennas. The Tutorial will conclude with an analysis of the case when an OCA-ICs is integrated into medicines in order to provide secure validation of medicinal pills and capsules.",

The mapping system provides the physical map of the space, and the positioning system identifies the position within the map. Outdoor location services have thrived over the last couple of decades because of well-established platforms for both these components (e.g. Google Maps for mapping, and GPS for positioning). In contrast, indoor location services haven't caught up because of the lack of reliable mapping and positioning frameworks. Wi-Fi positioning lacks maps and is also prone to environmental errors. In this paper, we present DLoc, a Deep Learning based wireless localization algorithm that can overcome traditional limitations of RF-based localization approaches (like multipath, occlusions, etc.). We augment DLoc with an automated mapping platform, MapFind. MapFind constructs location-tagged maps of the environment and generates training data for DLoc. Together, they allow off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices like smartphones to access a map of the environment and to estimate their position with respect to that map. During our evaluation, MapFind has collected location estimates of over 105 thousand points under 8 different scenarios with varying furniture positions and people motion across two different spaces covering 2000 sq. Ft. DLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods in Wi-Fi-based localization by 80% (median &amp; 90th percentile) across the two different spaces.",

                    "abstract": "Quantum entanglement enables important computing applications such as quantum key distribution. Based on quantum entanglement, quantum networks are built to provide long-distance secret sharing between two remote communication parties. Establishing a multi-hop quantum entanglement exhibits a high failure rate, and existing quantum networks rely on trusted repeater nodes to transmit quantum bits. However, when the scale of a quantum network increases, it requires end-to-end multi-hop quantum entanglements in order to deliver secret bits without letting the repeaters know the secret bits. This work focuses on the entanglement routing problem, whose objective is to build long-distance entanglements via untrusted repeaters for concurrent source-destination pairs through multiple hops. Different from existing work that analyzes the traditional routing techniques on special network topologies, we present a comprehensive entanglement routing model that reflects the differences between quantum networks and classical networks as well as a new entanglement routing algorithm that utilizes the unique properties of quantum networks. Evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm Q-CAST increases the number of successful long-distance entanglements by a big margin compared to other methods. The model and simulator developed by this work may encourage more network researchers to study the entanglement routing problem.",

In this work we demonstrate the capabilities of FlexRAN, an open-source SD-RAN platform developed to fill this void. FlexRAN separates the RAN control and data planes with a custom-tailored southbound API. Besides it features a hierarchical control plane architecture that enables programmability, flexible and dynamic control function placement (allowing different degrees of coordination within and among base stations) and real-time control. Virtualized control functions and control delegation are two key features in FlexRAN that makes these capabilities possible. This demo illustrates the capabilities and the performance of FlexRAN based on a prototype implementation, while its applicability is highlighted through a Mobile Edge Computing use case, where it acts as an enabler of a video bitrate adaptation application based on the radio conditions at the network edge.",

LLAP utilizes speakers and microphones on Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) mobile devices to play and record sound waves that are inaudible to humans. By measuring the phase of the sound signal reflected by the hands or fingers of the user, we can accurately measure the gesture movements. With a single pair of speaker/microphone, LLAP can track hand movement with accuracy of 3.5 mm. For devices with two microphones, LLAP enables drawing-in-the air capability with tracking accuracy of 4.6 mm. Moreover, the latency for LLAP is smaller than 15 ms for both the Android and the iOS platforms so that LLAP can be used for real-time applications.",

                    "abstract": "This half-day tutorial will explore edge computing through hands-on development activities using a physical edge computing platform. With the recent trends in the networking ecosystem-the rise of IoT devices, high bandwidth wireless, and powerful, energy-efficient, and inexpensive computation-edge computing is a promising technology for highly interactive and immersive environments. This tutorial aims to promote awareness of the possibilities of edge computing in general and introduce attendees to the tools that they can use to begin exploring this space. The tutorial's activities will give attendees hands-on experience with the ParaDrop edge computing platform developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. We hope to impart working knowledge about edge computing and our vision for its future. Recent developments in home wireless networks such as the proliferation of connected devices (e.g. Internet-of-Things) and gigabit wireless (e.g. 802.11ac) create an environment where edge computing can truly enhance applications. The availability of low latency and high bandwidth at the network edge but not necessarily end-to-end to the cloud, can enable interesting new applications involving video (e.g. augmented reality), low latency sensor-actuator coordination, and other public safety or educational applications. However, before such applications emerge, there needs to be a platform available for them. We argue that the availability of widespread platforms and standards for edge computing will unleash a new wave of innovation much like the creation of app markets for mobile devices. The hardware exists, e.g. in the form of millions of always-on Wi-Fi routers in homes and businesses, but it is not very programmable. With our tutorial, we aim to foster awareness of the possibilities that exist with edge computing and promote the advancement of research toward good standards for its realization. We introduce the ParaDrop platform as an open source demonstration of our vision for edge computing. We have been single-mindedly focused on researcher and developer needs in creating the ParaDrop platform. As such, applications that are already written to be run as cloud services can be easily modified to run on the ParaDrop platform in order to benefit from running at the network edge. Applications are not required to be written in a highly specialized language, and applications are able to leverage the rapidly growing software ecosystem surrounding Docker. Our tutorial will give researchers a hands-on experience with the platform and knowledge that they will be able to use beyond the workshop.",

However, most existing IoT devices cannot perform beamforming due to form factor, energy, and cost constraints. This paper presents RFlens, a reconfigurable metasurface that empowers low-profile IoT devices with beamforming capabilities. The metasurface consists of many unit-cells, each acting as a phase shifter for signals going through it. By encoding the phase shifting values, RFlens can manipulate electromagnetic waves to \"reshape\" and resteer the beam pattern. We prototype RFlens for 5 GHz Wi-Fi signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RFlens can achieve a 4.6 dB median signal strength improvement (up to 9.3 dB) even with a relatively small 16 \\texttimes{} 16 array of unit-cells. In addition, RFlens can effectively improve the secrecy capacity of IoT links and enable passive NLoS wireless sensing applications.",

So, millimeter-wave (mmWave) would exacerbate the device overheating problem in the future. In this work, we first perform a thermal characterization of mmWave devices: it reveals that after only 10 s. of data transfer at 1.9 Gbps, the antenna temperature reaches 68\u00b0C; it reduces the link throughput by 21%, increases the standard deviation by 6\\texttimes{}, and takes 130 s. to dissipate the heat completely. We then propose Aquilo to bring temperature-awareness in mmWave networks; Aquilo maintains relatively high throughput performance and cools down the devices substantially. Our testbed experiments in static conditions show that Aquilo reaches a median peak temperature just 1\u00b0C above the optimal with less than 10% throughput sacrifice only.",

A popular alternative comprises offloading CNN processing to powerful cloud-based servers. Nevertheless, by relying on the cloud to produce outputs, emerging mission-critical and high-mobility applications, such as drone obstacle avoidance or interactive applications, can suffer from the dynamic connectivity conditions and the uncertain availability of the cloud. In this paper, we propose SPINN, a distributed inference system that employs synergistic device-cloud computation together with a progressive inference method to deliver fast and robust CNN inference across diverse settings. The proposed system introduces a novel scheduler that co-optimises the early-exit policy and the CNN splitting at run time, in order to adapt to dynamic conditions and meet user-defined service-level requirements. Quantitative evaluation illustrates that SPINN outperforms its state-of-the-art collaborative inference counterparts by up to 2\\texttimes{} in achieved throughput under varying network conditions, reduces the server cost by up to 6.8\\texttimes{} and improves accuracy by 20.7% under latency constraints, while providing robust operation under uncertain connectivity conditions and significant energy savings compared to cloud-centric execution.",

                    "abstract": "Persistent packet loss in the cloud-scale overlay network severely compromises tenant experiences. Cloud providers are keen to automatically and quickly determine the root cause of such problems. However, existing work is either designed for the physical network or insufficient to present the concrete reason of packet loss. In this paper, we propose to record and analyze the on-site forwarding condition of packets during packet-level tracing. The cloud-scale overlay network presents great challenges to achieve this goal with its high network complexity, multi-tenant nature, and diversity of root causes. To address these challenges, we present VTrace, an automatic diagnostic system for persistent packet loss over the cloud-scale overlay network. Utilizing the \"fast path-slow path\" structure of virtual forwarding devices (VFDs), e.g., vSwitches, VTrace installs several \"coloring, matching and logging\" rules in VFDs to selectively track the packets of interest and inspect them in depth. The detailed forwarding situation at each hop is logged and then assembled to perform analysis with an efficient path reconstruction scheme. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate VTrace's low overhead and quick responsiveness. We share experiences of how VTrace efficiently resolves persistent packet loss issues after deploying it in Alibaba Cloud for over 20 months.",

In this paper, we revive the lost capacity by reconfiguring the wavelengths from cut fibers into healthy fibers. We highlight two challenges that made prior solutions impractical and propose a system called Arrow to address them. First, our measurements show that contrary to common belief, in most cases, the lost capacity is only partially restorable. This poses a cross-layer challenge from the Traffic Engineering (TE) perspective that has not been considered before: \u201cWhich IP links should be restored and by how much to best match the TE objective?\u201d To address this challenge, Arrow's restoration-aware TE system takes a set of partial restoration candidates (that we call LotteryTickets) as input and proactively finds the best restoration plan. Second, prior work has not considered the reconfiguration latency of amplifiers. However, in practical settings, amplifiers add tens of minutes of reconfiguration delay. To enable fast and practical restoration, Arrow leverages optical noise loading and bypasses amplifier reconfiguration altogether. We evaluate Arrow using large-scale simulations and a testbed. Our testbed demonstrates Arrow's end-to-end restoration latency is eight seconds. Our large-scale simulations compare Arrow to the state-of-the-art TE schemes and show it can support 2.0x--2.4x more demand without compromising 99.99% availability.",

Today, there is an unmet need in providing such analytics in an interactive manner, especially over weak Internet connections, to quickly diagnose and solve problems in the commercial industry space of monitoring assets using drones in remote parts of the world. Existing mechanisms either compromise on the quality of insights by not building 3D images and analyze individual 2D images in isolation, or spend tens of minutes building a 3D image before obtaining and uploading insights. We present Visage, a system that accelerates 3D image analytics by identifying smaller parts of the data that can actually benefit from 3D analytics and prioritizing building, and uploading the localized 3D images for those parts. To achieve this, Visage uses a graph to represent raw 2D images and their relative content overlap, and then identifies the various subgraphs using application knowledge that are good candidates for localized 3D image based insights. We evaluate Visage using data from multiple real deployments and show that it can reduce analytics-latency by up to four orders of magnitude.",

DeepCache benefits model execution efficiency by exploiting temporal locality in input video streams. It addresses a key challenge raised by mobile vision: the cache must operate under video scene variation, while trading off among cacheability, overhead, and loss in model accuracy. At the input of a model, DeepCache discovers video temporal locality by exploiting the video's internal structure, for which it borrows proven heuristics from video compression; into the model, DeepCache propagates regions of reusable results by exploiting the model's internal structure. Notably, DeepCache eschews applying video heuristics to model internals which are not pixels but high-dimensional, difficult-to-interpret data. Our implementation of DeepCache works with unmodified deep learning models, requires zero developer's manual effort, and is therefore immediately deployable on off-the-shelf mobile devices. Our experiments show that DeepCache saves inference execution time by 18% on average and up to 47%. DeepCache reduces system energy consumption by 20% on average.",

While there have been various designs around sketches, they focus on measuring one particular flow key, and it is infeasible to support many keys based on these sketches. In this work, we take a significant step towards supporting arbitrary partial key queries, where we only need to specify a full range of possible flow keys that are of interest before measurement starts, and in query time, we can extract the information of any key in that range. We design CocoSketch, which casts arbitrary partial key queries to the subset sum estimation problem and makes the theoretical tools for subset sum estimation practical. To realize desirable resource-accuracy tradeoffs in software and hardware platforms, we propose two techniques: (1) stochastic variance minimization to significantly reduce per-packet update delay, and (2) removing circular dependencies in the per-packet update logic to make the implementation hardware-friendly. We implement CocoSketch on four popular platforms (CPU, Open vSwitch, P4, and FPGA) and show that compared to baselines that use traditional single-key sketches, CocoSketch improves average packet processing throughput by 27.2x and accuracy by 10.4x when measuring six flow keys.",

Developing such safety technologies requires an understanding of not just common highway and city traffic situations but also a plethora of widely different unusual events (e.g., object on the road way and pedestrian crossing highway, etc.). While each such event may be rare, in aggregate they represent a significant risk that technology must address to develop truly dependable automated driving and traffic safety technologies. By developing technology to scale road data acquisition to a large number of vehicles, this paper introduces a low-cost yet reliable solution, BigRoad, that can derive internal driver inputs (i.e., steering wheel angles, driving speed and acceleration) and external perceptions of road environments (i.e., road conditions and front-view video) using a smartphone and an IMU mounted in a vehicle. We evaluate the accuracy of collected internal and external data using over 140 real-driving trips collected in a 3-month time period. Results show that BigRoad can accurately estimate the steering wheel angle with 0.69 degree median error, and derive the vehicle speed with 0.65 km/h deviation. The system is also able to determine binary road conditions with 95% accuracy by capturing a small number of brakes. We further validate the usability of BigRoad by pushing the collected video feed and steering wheel angle to a deep neural network steering wheel angle predictor, showing the potential of massive data acquisition for training self-driving system using BigRoad.",

Achieving high tracking accuracy is essential to provide enjoyable user experience. To this end, we develop a novel system that uses audio signals to achieve mm-level tracking accuracy. It lets multiple speakers transmit inaudible sounds at different frequencies. Based on the received sound, our system continuously estimates the distance and velocity of the mobile with respect to the speakers to continuously track it. At its heart lies a distributed Frequency Modulated Continuous Waveform (FMCW) that can accurately estimate the absolute distance between a transmitter and a receiver that are separate and unsynchronized. We further develop an optimization framework to combine FMCW estimation with Doppler shifts and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements to enhance the accuracy, and efficiently solve the optimization problem. We implement two systems: one on a desktop and another on a mobile phone. Our evaluation and user study show that our system achieves high tracking accuracy and ease of use using existing hardware.",

In recent years, some have invested heavily in deploying services and servers inside end-user networks. With several dozen Hypergiants and thousands of servers deployed inside networks, these off-net (meaning outside the Hypergiant networks) deployments change the structure of the Internet. Previous efforts to study them have relied on proprietary data or specialized per-Hypergiant measurement techniques that neither scale nor generalize, providing a limited view of content delivery on today's Internet.In this paper, we develop a generic and easy to implement methodology to measure the expansion of Hypergiants' off-nets. Our key observation is that Hypergiants increasingly encrypt their traffic to protect their customers' privacy. Thus, we can analyze publicly available Internet-wide scans of port 443 and retrieve TLS certificates to discover which IP addresses host Hypergiant certificates in order to infer the networks hosting off-nets for the corresponding Hypergiants. Our results show that the number of networks hosting Hypergiant off-nets has tripled from 2013 to 2021, reaching 4.5k networks. The largest Hypergiants dominate these deployments, with almost all of these networks hosting an off-net for at least one -- and increasingly two or more -- of Google, Netflix, Facebook, or Akamai. These four Hypergiants have off-nets within networks that provide access to a significant fraction of end user population.",

                    "abstract": "Omnidirectional lighting provides the foundation for achieving spatially-variant photorealistic 3D rendering, a desirable property for mobile augmented reality applications. However, in practice, estimating omnidirectional lighting can be challenging due to limitations such as partial panoramas of the rendering positions, and the inherent environment lighting and mobile user dynamics. A new opportunity arises recently with the advancements in mobile 3D vision, including built-in high-accuracy depth sensors and deep learning-powered algorithms, which provide the means to better sense and understand the physical surroundings. Centering the key idea of 3D vision, in this work, we design an edge-assisted framework called Xihe to provide mobile AR applications the ability to obtain accurate omnidirectional lighting estimation in real time.Specifically, we develop a novel sampling technique that efficiently compresses the raw point cloud input generated at the mobile device. This technique is derived based on our empirical analysis of a recent 3D indoor dataset and plays a key role in our 3D vision-based lighting estimator pipeline design. To achieve the realtime goal, we develop a tailored GPU pipeline for on-device point cloud processing and use an encoding technique that reduces network transmitted bytes. Finally, we present an adaptive triggering strategy that allows Xihe to skip unnecessary lighting estimations and a practical way to provide temporal coherent rendering integration with the mobile AR ecosystem. We evaluate both the lighting estimation accuracy and time of Xihe using a reference mobile application developed with Xihe's APIs. Our results show that Xihe takes as fast as 20.67ms per lighting estimation and achieves 9.4% better estimation accuracy than a state-of-the-art neural network.",

Existing visible light positioning (VLP) systems [5, 7] leverage the high image resolution of a receiving camera to support high positioning accuracy. However, power-hungry cameras are not desirable in many scenarios, e.g., smart factories, where small objects need to be accurately located and tracked. In this demo, we introduce CELLI, an indoor VLP system that only uses a single luminary as the transmitter and requires only a simple light sensor to achieve high accuracy with centimeter-level error. The key idea is to provide the spatial resolution capability from the transmitter instead of the receiver, so that the complexity of the receiver can be minimized. In particular, a small Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) is installed at the transmitter to project a large number of narrow and interference-free polarized light beams to different spatial cells. A receiving light sensor identifies its located cell by detecting the unique polarization-modulated signals projected to that cell, as shown in Fig. 1. CELLI further incorporates several novel designs to overcome the technical challenges such as reducing the positioning latency, which is typically limited by the long optical response time of an LCD, and transforming a cell coordinate to the global 3D position using only a single light. We have prototyped our design using off-the-shelf optical and electronic components, and experimentally shown that CELLI achieves a median 3D positioning error less than 12 cm and a median 2D error less than 2.7 cm.",

Vulcan first builds a state-model of a wearable app by offline training then steers the app to a target state for injecting mutated messages. The target state of the app typically runs a high number of concurrent processes. By testing a set of 100 popular Wear OS apps, Vulcan was able to trigger 45 unique crashes and 18 system reboots. These system reboots are triggered by a fuzzing user-level app and we present a mitigation strategy to prevent it.",

Unfortunately, it is also one of the most time-consuming and expensive tasks: placing measurement tools in remote networks or end-clients requires one to marshal resources from different administrative domains, devices, populations, and countries. Often such efforts culminate in a trace that is deficient in multiple ways: a small set of test subjects, a short time frame, missing ground truth for device IDs, networking environments lacking in diversity and geographic spread, or highly biased sampling. We present a method of addressing these challenges by leveraging the most open and globally accessible test and measurement platform: digital advertising. Digital advertising instantly provides a window into 7 billion devices spanning every county for an extremely low cost. We propose Advertising as a Platform (AaaP), an ad-based system to perform massive-scale mobile measurement studies. In contrast with measurements made by large media companies who own platforms, ad networks, and apps, we concentrate on the opportunities and challenges for researchers that are end-users of advertising systems. We evaluate a prototype system, discuss ethical guidelines, and demonstrate its use in four scenarios: IP2Geo databases, bandwidth measurement, energy management, and the identifiability of mobile users. We show the efficacy and ease-of-use of AaaP, and illuminate key challenges and the great promise of using AaaP to study a wide variety of mobile phenomena.",

Despite their ease of use and ubiquitous availability, experiences in living together are still far incomparable to those through remote face-to-face communication. We envision that enabling a remote person to be spatially superposed in one's living space would be a breakthrough to catalyze pseudo living-together interactivity. We propose HomeMeld, a zero-hassle self-mobile robotic system serving as a co-present avatar to create a persistent illusion of living together for those who are involuntarily living apart. The key challenges are 1) continuous spatial mapping between two heterogeneous floor plans and 2) navigating the robotic avatar to reflect the other's presence in real time under the limited maneuverability of the robot. We devise a notion of functionally equivalent location and orientation to translate a person's presence into another in a heterogeneous floor plan. We also develop predictive path warping to seamlessly synchronize the presence of the other. We conducted extensive experiments and deployment studies with real participants.",

Having to download and run anti-censorship software can put users at risk, and does not help the many users who do not even realize they are being censored in the first place.In this paper, we present the first purely server-side censorship evasion strategies---11 in total. We extend a recent tool, Geneva, to automate the discovery and implementation of server-side strategies, and we apply it to four countries (China, India, Iran, and Kazakhstan) and five protocols (DNS-over-TCP, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, and SMTP). We also perform follow-on experiments to understand why the strategies Geneva finds work, and to glean new insights into how censors operate. Among these, we find that China runs a completely separate network stack (each with its own unique bugs) for each application-layer protocol that it censors.The server-side techniques we find are easier and safer to deploy than client-side strategies. Our code and data are publicly available.",

However, for systems-centric work on these topics, the research community must first overcome the hurdle of implementing fine-grained, over-the-air timing synchronization, which is critical for any coordinated operation. To address this gap, this paper presents an open-source design and implementation of 'RFClock' that provides timing, frequency and phase synchronization for software defined radios (SDRs). It shows how RFClock can be used for a practical, 5-node DCB application without modifying existing physical/link layer protocols. By utilizing a leader-follower architecture, RFClock-leader allows follower clocks to synchronize with mean offset under 0.107Hz, and then corrects the time/phase alignment to be within a 5ns deviation. RFClock is designed to operate in generalized environments: as standalone unit, it generates a 10MHz/1PPS signal reference suitable for most commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) SDRs today; it does not require custom protocol-specific headers or messaging; and it is robust to interference through a frequency-agile operation. Using RFClock for DCB, we verify significant increase in channel gain and low BER in a range of [0 -- 10--3] for different modulation schemes. We also demonstrate performance that is similar to a popular wired solution and significant improvement over a GPS-based solution, while delivering this functionality at a fractional price/power point.",

This can not only reduce cost, but also support video taping in situations where otherwise not possible (e.g., during private moments or at inconvenient locations like indoor rock climbing). While there have been many follow-me drones on the market for outdoors, which rely on GPS, enabling indoor follow-me function is more challenging due to the lack of an effective approach to track users in indoor environments. To this end, we develop a holistic system that lets a mobile phone carried by a user accurately track the drone's relative location and control it to maintain a specified distance and orientation for automatic video taping. We develop a series of techniques to (i) track a drone's location using acoustic signals with sub-centimeter errors even under strong propeller noise from the drone and complicated multipath in indoor environments, and (ii) solve practical challenges in applying model predictive control (MPC) framework to control the drone. The latter consists of developing measurement-based flight models, designing measurement techniques to provide feedback to the controller, and predicting the user's movement. We implement our system on AR Drone 2.0 and Samsung S7. The extensive evaluation shows that our drone can follow a user effectively and maintain a specified following distance and orientation within 2-3 cm and 1-3 degree errors, respectively. The videos taped by the drone during flight are smooth according to the jerk metric.",

However, a limitation of existing systems is that they often sense only a narrow part of the light spectrum. We argue that the ability to sense a broad light spectrum significantly enhances ability of such systems expanding possible application scenarios. We demonstrate our work in progress to develop the concept of polymorphic light sensing~(PLS). PLS sensor morphs itself according to applications requirements, to track desired parts of the light spectrum (colours, infrared, and ultraviolet light). We couple the PLS sensor with ultra-low power backscatter mechanism, and demonstrate this enables us to sense and communicate the broad spectrum, while operating battery-free.",

In the mobile and pervasive computing community, there was a struggle on data collection for the evaluation of human-sensing systems. An automated and contactless solution to collect data from users at home is one way that can help in the continuation of user-centric studies. In this poster, we present a portable system for remote, in-home data collection. The system is powered by a Raspberry Pi\u00a9 and input peripherals (a camera, a microphone, and a wireless receiver). Our system uses a speech interface for text-to-speech and speech-to-text conversions. The system acts as a voice-based \"smart agent\" that guides the user during an experiment session. We aim to use our system to collect data from a set of smart pill bottles that we previously designed for medication adherence monitoring [1] and user identification [3].",

                    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose XModal-ID, a novel WiFi-video cross-modal gait-based person identification system. Given the WiFi signal measured when an unknown person walks in an unknown area and a video footage of a walking person in another area, XModal-ID can determine whether it is the same person in both cases or not. XModal-ID only uses the Channel State Information (CSI) magnitude measurements of a pair of off-the-shelf WiFi transceivers. It does not need any prior wireless or video measurement of the person to be identified. Similarly, it does not need any knowledge of the operation area or person's track. Finally, it can identify people through walls. XModal-ID utilizes the video footage to simulate the WiFi signal that would be generated if the person in the video walked near a pair of WiFi transceivers. It then uses a new processing approach to robustly extract key gait features from both the real WiFi signal and the video-based simulated one, and compares them to determine if the person in the WiFi area is the same person in the video. We extensively evaluate XModal-ID by building a large test set with $8$ subjects, $2$ video areas, and $5$ WiFi areas, including 3 through-wall areas as well as complex walking paths, all of which are not seen during the training phase. Overall, we have a total of 2,256 WiFi-video test pairs. XModal-ID then achieves an $85%$ accuracy in predicting whether a pair of WiFi and video samples belong to the same person or not. Furthermore, in a ranking scenario where XModal-ID compares a WiFi sample to $8$ candidate video samples, it obtains top-1, top-2, and top-3 accuracies of $75%$, $90%$, and $97%$. These results show that XModal-ID can robustly identify new people walking in new environments, in various practical scenarios.",

XLINK is designed to meet two operational challenges at the same time: (1) Optimized user-perceived quality of experience (QoE) in terms of robustness, smoothness, responsiveness, and mobility and (2) Minimized cost overhead for service providers (typically CDNs). The core of XLINK is to take the opportunity of QUIC as a user-space protocol and directly capture user-perceived video QoE intent to control multi-path scheduling and management. We overcome major hurdles such as multi-path head-of-line blocking, network heterogeneity, and rapid link variations and balance cost and performance.To the best of our knowledge, XLINK is the first large-scale experimental study of multi-path QUIC video services in production environments. We present the results of over 3 million e-commerce product short-video plays from consumers who upgraded to Taobao android app with XLINK. Our study shows that compared to single-path QUIC, XLINK achieved 19 to 50% improvement in the 99-th percentile video-chunk request completion time, 32% improvement in the 99-th percentile first-video-frame latency, 23 to 67% improvement in the re-buffering rate at the expense of 2.1% redundant traffic.",

Navigation systems for such environments need to strike a balance between price and precision. In this paper, we propose magnetic vehicular positioning (MVP), a navigation system that guides drivers in GNSS-denied environments. The key idea of MVP is to extract magnetic fingerprints from geomagnetic field anomalies. By comparing the measured magnetic field against a magnetic map, positioning can be achieved without GNSS signals. Our proposed matching algorithm allows MVP to provide 5.14 m positioning accuracy. We conducted large-scale real-road experiments for 36 months in two countries and 56 tunnels to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. Because MVP can be deployed on off-the-shelf smartphones, our approach makes accurate navigation in GNSS-denied environments affordable.",

But in modern society, many people have unhealthy sleep diaries and suffer from various sleep disorders, which may result in irregular mood fluctuations or even mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. We propose the Emotion-Aware Smart Tips (EAST), a novel approach that could help to inform users about their irregular emotional states with smart tips to improve their sleep qualities. EAST aims at helping users keep healthy sleep schedules and emotional states by providing smart tips through a novel model that combines multivariate regression, random forest, and neural network to quantify the relations between sleep patterns and emotional states. Prototype implementation and initial experiments of EAST in mobile phones have demonstrated its desired functionality and practicality for real-world deployment.",

                    "abstract": "Since the introduction of the smartphone, mobile computing has become pervasive in our society. Meanwhile, Mobile devices have evolved far beyond the stereotypical personal devices and been employed in various traditional real-time embedded domains. Of the currently available mobile systems, Android has seen the most widespread deployment outside of the consumer electronics market. Its open source nature has prompted its ubiquitous adoption in sensing, medical, robotics, and autopilot applications. However, it is not surprising that Android does not provide any real-time guarantee since it is designed as a mobile system and optimised for mobility, user experience, and energy efficiency. Although there has been much interest in adopting Android in real-time contexts, surprisingly little work has been done to examine the suitability of Android for real-time systems. Existing work only provides solutions to traditional problems, including real-time garbage collection at the virtual machine layer, real-time OS scheduling and resource management. While it is critical to address these issues, it is by no means sufficient. After all, Android is a vast system that is more than a Java virtual machine and a kernel.Our work examines the internals of Android, the Android programming model, libraries and core systems services. We discuss the implications and challenges of adapting Android constructs and core system services for real-time and present a solution for each, name RTDroid, as a whole system. It is unique in that it redesigns Android's internal components, replaces Android's Dalvik/ART with a real-time Java virtual machine, FijiVM, and leverages off-the-shelf real-time OSes.RTDroid also provides an event-driven programming model for the development of real-time applications. To retain a familiar style of Android application, we make a number of changes to the Android abstractions and how they interact with the underlying system as well as each other. We aim to leave legacy Android code unaffected and expose real-time features to components which have timeliness requirements. More specifically, Our programming model consist of four parts: 1) real-time constructs for real-time expressiveness, 2) a real-time extension to Android's application manifest for the real-time configuration, 3) real-time communication channels that enable construct interactions with real-time semantics, 4) pause-less memory management with scoped memory.To validate the predictability of RTDroid's implementation, we firstly report a number of micro-benchmark results with RTDroid basic constructs. Then, we demonstrate three real-world applications implemented in RTDroid and provide statistic results. Our results illustrate that, at least in these use-cases, the modified platform delivers significantly better time predictability than stock Android and reduces the code complexity as compared to the traditional real-time programming paradigm, RTSJ.",

These 3D sensors are used for improving vehicular safety in autonomous driving, but have fundamentally limited visibility due to occlusions, sensing range, and extreme weather and lighting conditions. To improve visibility and performance, not just for autonomous vehicles but for other Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS), we explore a capability called Augmented Vehicular Reality (AVR). AVR broadens the vehicle's visual horizon by enabling it to wirelessly share visual information with other nearby vehicles, but requires the design of novel relative positioning techniques, new perspective transformation methods, approaches to isolate and predict the motion of dynamic objects in order to hide latency, and adaptive transmission strategies to cope with wireless bandwidth variability. We show that AVR is feasible using off-the-shelf wireless technologies, and it can qualitatively change the decisions made by autonomous vehicle path planning algorithms. Our AVR prototype achieves positioning accuracies that are within a few percent of car lengths and lane widths, and is optimized to process frames at 30fps.",

A lot of research work in SIoT has proposed the use of social networking data for community and trust management in SIoT networks. While it seems like an interesting choice, it is important to analyze the effectiveness of social networking data for application to SIoT. In this paper, we analyze the accuracy of using tie information from the Facebook Friend Graph to mimic real-world SIoT network ties. We also discuss a method for ranking the strength of ties in a SIoT network by analyzing the structure of the Facebook Friend Graph. A similar analysis can be performed on data available from other Social Networking platforms, like Twitter, LinkedIn etc.",

The goal of neural weight virtualization is two-fold: (1) packing multiple DNNs into a fixed-sized main memory whose combined memory requirement is larger than the main memory, and (2) enabling fast in-memory execution of the DNNs. To this end, we propose a two-phase approach: (1) virtualization of weight parameters for fine-grained parameter sharing at the level of weights that scales up to multiple heterogeneous DNNs of arbitrary network architectures, and (2) in-memory data structure and run-time execution framework for in-memory execution and context-switching of DNN tasks. We implement two multitask learning systems: (1) an embedded GPU-based mobile robot, and (2) a microcontroller-based IoT device. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed algorithms as well as the two systems that involve ten state-of-the-art DNNs. Our evaluation shows that weight virtualization improves memory efficiency, execution time, and energy efficiency of the multitask learning systems by 4.1x, 36.9x, and 4.2x, respectively.",

The wisdom arises from the fact that different liquid molecules have various viscosity coefficients, so they need to overcome dissimilitude energy barriers during relative motion. With this intuition in mind, we introduce a novel model that measures liquids' viscosity based on active vibration. Yet, it is challenging to build up a robust system utilizing the built-in accelerometer in smartphones. Practical issues include under-sampling, self-interference, and volume change impact. Instead of machine learning, we tackle these issues through multiple signal processing stages to reconstruct the original signals and cancel out the interference. Our approach could achieve the liquid viscosity estimates with a mean relative error of 2.9% and distinguish 30 kinds of liquid with an average accuracy of 95.47%.",

We show that media sounds, such as the melodies of notification tones (e.g., iPhone message and Samsung whistle) can be directly used to sense and verify the user's gripping hand. Because sounds and vibrations co-exist, we capture two novel responses via the smartphone mic and accelerometer to describe how the individual's contacting palm interferes with the signals in two different domains. Based on the two responses, we develop a convolutional neural network-based algorithm to verify the user. Moreover, because the smartphone sensors are all embedded on the same motherboard, we develop a cross-domain method to validate such hard-to-forge physical relationships among the mic, speaker and accelerometer. They prevent external sounds from cheating the system. Additionally, we consider the notification vibration as a special type of media sound, which also results in two responses, and extend our method to work in the silent mode. Extensive experiments with ten notification tones and four phone models show that our system verifies users with 95% accuracy and prevents replay sounds with 100% accuracy.",

Volumetric videos are truly 3D, allowing six degrees of freedom (6DoF) movement for their viewers during playback. Such flexibility enables numerous applications in entertainment, healthcare, education, etc. However, volumetric video streaming is extremely bandwidth-intensive. We conduct a detailed investigation of each of the following aspects for point cloud streaming (a popular volumetric data format): encoding, decoding, segmentation, viewport movement patterns, and viewport prediction. Motivated by the observations from the above study, we propose ViVo, which is to the best of our knowledge the first practical mobile volumetric video streaming system with three visibility-aware optimizations. ViVo judiciously determines the video content to fetch based on how, what and where a viewer perceives for reducing bandwidth consumption of volumetric video streaming. Our evaluations over real wireless networks (including commercial 5G), mobile devices and users indicate that ViVo can save on average 40% of data usage (up to 80%) with virtually no drop in visual quality.",

Over half of these individuals will have residual deficits, making stroke one of the leading causes of disability. Long-term rehabilitation opportunities are critical for millions of individuals with chronic upper limb motor deicits due to stroke. Traditional in-home rehabilitation is reported to be dull, boring, and un-engaging. Moreover, existing rehabilitation technologies are not user-friendly and cannot be adaptable to different and ever-changing demands from individual stroke survivors. In this work, we present RehabPhone, a highly-usable software-defined stroke rehabilitation paradigm using the smartphone and 3D printing technologies. This software-definition has twofold. First, RehabPhone leverages the cost-effective 3D printing technology to augment ordinal smartphones into customized rehabilitation tools. The size, weight, and shape of rehabilitation tools are software-defined according to individual rehabilitation needs and goals. Second, RehabPhone integrates 13 functional rehabilitation activities co-designed with stroke professionals into a smartphone APP. The software utilizes built-in smartphone sensors to analyzes rehabilitation activities and provides real-time feedback to coach and engage stroke users. We perform the in-lab usability optimization with the RehabPhone prototype with involving 16 healthy adults and 4 stroke survivors. After that, we conduct a 6-week unattended intervention study in 12 homes of stroke residence. In the course of the clinical study, over 32,000 samples of physical rehabilitation activities are collected and evaluated. Results indicate that stroke users with RehabPhone demonstrate a high adherence and clinical efficacy in a self-managed home-based rehabilitation course. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exploratory clinical study using mobile health technologies in real-world stroke rehabilitation.",

A key challenge for our system is how to efficiently detect body movement and accurately calculate range of joint motion. We built a preliminary version that can collect and analyze sensor data in real time on the Android platform. To test the system, we recruited five healthy volunteers and measured six kinds of joint motions. The same tools used by physical therapists, measurements gathered from a goniometer and an inclinometer is what we used as the ground truth data for calibrations and evaluation of our algorithm. In the initial version, GonioSense estimation errors are within \u00b1 5% for more than 80% cases. By utilizing wearable technology, the benefits for both doctors and patients could bring forth an immense step forward in physical therapy treatment.",

It has been deployed worldwide to support two call services: VoLTE (Voice over LTE) and VoWi-Fi (Voice over Wi-Fi). VoWi-Fi enables telephony calls over the Wi-Fi network to complement VoLTE. In this work, we uncover that the VoWi-Fi signaling session can be hijacked to maliciously manipulate the IMS call operation. An adversary can easily make ghost calls to launch a stealthy call DoS (Denial of Service) attack against specific cellular users. Only phone numbers, but not any malware or network information, are required from the victims. This sophisticated attack harnesses a design defect of the IMS call state machine, but not simply flooding or a crash trigger. To stealthily detect attackable phones at run time, we exploit a vulnerability of the 4G network infrastructure, call information leakage, which we explore using machine learning. We validate these vulnerabilities in operational 4G networks of 4 top-tier carriers across Asia and North America countries with 7 phone brands. Our result shows that the call DoS attack can prevent the victims from receiving incoming calls up to 99.0% time without user awareness. We finally propose and evaluate recommended solutions.",

For instance, a user of a video editing app would be able to use a smart pad as a canvas and a smartphone as a remote toolbox so that the toolbox does not occlude the canvas during editing. However, existing approaches do not properly support the single-app multi-device execution due to several limitations, including high development cost, device heterogeneity, and high performance requirement. In this paper, we introduce FLUID-XP, a novel cross-platform multi-device system that enables UIs of a single app to be executed across heterogeneous platforms, while overcoming the limitations of previous approaches. FLUID-XP provides flexible, efficient, and seamless interactions by addressing three main challenges: i) how to transparently enable a single-display app to use multiple displays, ii) how to distribute UIs across heterogeneous devices with minimal network traffic, and iii) how to optimize the UI distribution process when multiple UIs have different distribution requirements. Our experiments with a working prototype of FLUID-XP on Android confirm that FLUID-XP successfully supports a variety of unmodified real-world apps across heterogeneous platforms (Android, iOS, and Linux). We also conduct a lab study with 25 participants to demonstrate the effectiveness of FLUID-XP with real users.",

It has been extensively studied in different disciplines, such as fault-tolerant computing, distributed computing, control, and robotics communities. To our surprise, we have not found any practical algorithm that is appropriate for our target scenario - a system of small things that have limited computation and storage capability, and use lossy wireless links to communicate with each other.This work first identifies the limitations of prior algorithms. Then we present two fault-tolerant approximate consensus algorithms, which minimizes storage complexity. In an n-node system, the first algorithm tolerates crash faults and only needs to store 4 values and an n-bit bit-vector, whereas the second algorithm tolerates up to f Byzantine faults, and needs to store 2f + 4 values and an n-bit bit-vector. In practice, these values are implemented using either integer or float data type. Compared to our algorithms, prior works may need to store O(nD) more values, where D is the number of rounds needed for convergence.",

Examples include cognitive apps (e.g., speech recognition, natural language translation, as well as face, object, or gesture detection and recognition) and anticipatory apps that proactively track and provide services when needed. Unfortunately, today's mobile devices cannot keep pace with such apps, despite advances in hardware capability. Traditional approaches address this problem by computation offloading. One approach offloads by sending sensed streams to remote cloud servers via cellular networks or to cloudlets via Wi-Fi, where a clone of the app runs [2, 3, 4]. However, cloudlets may not be widely deployed and access to cloud infrastructure may yield high network delays and can be intermittent due to mobility. Morever, users might hesitate to upload private sensing data to the cloud or cloudlet. A second approach offloads to accelerators by rewriting code to use DSP or GPU within mobile devices. However, using accelerators requires substantial programming effort and produces varied benefits for diverse codes on heterogeneous devices.",

EQ-Radio transmits an RF signal and analyzes its reflections off a person's body to recognize his emotional state (happy, sad, etc.). The key enabler underlying EQ-Radio is a new algorithm for extracting the individual heartbeats from the wireless signal at an accuracy comparable to on-body ECG monitors. The resulting beats are then used to compute emotion-dependent features which feed a machine-learning emotion classifier. We describe the design and implementation of EQ-Radio, and demonstrate through a user study that its emotion recognition accuracy is on par with state-of-the-art emotion recognition systems that require a person to be hooked to an ECG monitor.",

In addition to the challenges of achieving low-power consumption and long-range communication, airdropping wireless sensors is difficult because it requires the sensor to survive the impact when dropped in mid-air. Our design takes inspiration from nature: small insects like ants can fall from tall buildings and survive because of their tiny mass and size. Inspired by this, we design insect-scale wireless sensors that come fully integrated with an onboard power supply and a lightweight mechanical actuator to detach from the aerial platform. Our system introduces a first-of-its-kind 37 mg mechanical release mechanism to drop the sensor during flight, using only 450 \u03bcJ of energy as well as a wireless communication link that can transmit sensor data at 33 kbps up to 1 km. Once deployed, our 98 mg wireless sensor can run for 1.3-2.5 years when transmitting 10-50 packets per hour on a 68 mg battery. We demonstrate attachment to a small 28 mm wide drone and a moth (Manduca sexta) and show that our insect-scale sensors flutter as they fall, suffering no damage on impact onto a tile floor from heights of 22 m.",

However, the small form-factor, low-profile hardware interfaces and computational resources limit their capabilities in security checking. Many wristband devices have recently witnessed alarming vulnerabilities, e.g., personal data leakage and payment fraud, due to the lack of authentication and access control. To fill this gap, we propose a secure text pin input system, namely Taprint, which extends a virtual number pad on the back of a user's hand. Taprint builds on the key observation that the hand \"landmarks'', especially finger knuckles, bear unique vibration characteristics when being tapped by the user herself. It thus uses the tapping vibrometry as biometrics to authenticate the user, while distinguishing the tapping locations. Taprint reuses the inertial measurement unit in the wristband, \"overclocks'' its sampling rate to extrapolate fine-grained features, and further refines the features to enhance the uniqueness and reliability. Extensive experiments on 128 users demonstrate that Taprint achieves a high accuracy (96%) of keystrokes recognition. It can authenticate users, even through a single-tap, at extremely low error rate (2.4%), and under various practical usage disturbances.",

This paper introduces TagScan, a system that can identify the material type and image the horizontal cut of a target simultaneously with cheap commercial off the-shelf (COTS) RFID devices. The key intuition is that different materials and target sizes cause different amounts of phase and RSS (Received Signal Strength) changes when radio frequency (RF) signal penetrates through the target. Multiple challenges need to be addressed before we can turn the idea into a functional system including (i) indoor environments exhibit rich multipath which breaks the linear relationship between the phase change and the propagation distance inside a target; (ii) without knowing either material type or target size, trying to obtain these two information simultaneously is challenging; and (iii) stitching pieces of the propagation distances inside a target for an image estimate is non-trivial. We propose solutions to all the challenges and evaluate the system's performance in three different environments. TagScan is able to achieve higher than 94% material identification accuracies for 10 liquids and differentiate even very similar objects such as Coke and Pepsi. TagScan can accurately estimate the horizontal cut images of more than one target behind a wall.",

DEMS consists of three key design decisions: (1) being aware of the chunk boundary and strategically decoupling the paths for chunk delivery, (2) ensuring simultaneous subflow completion at the receiver side, and (3) allowing a path to trade a small amount of redundant data for performance. We integrate the DEMS components into a holistic system and implement it on commodity mobile devices, where unmodified mobile applications can use DEMS to transmit data over multipath. We demonstrate the simple configuration of using DEMS over multipath, visualization of multipath scheduling, download time reduction of data chunks with DEMS over both emulated and real cellular/WiFi networks compared to default MinRTT scheduler, and application QoE improvement on mobile phones from DEMS.",

                    "abstract": "Tire wear is a leading cause of automobile accidents globally. Beyond safety, tire wear affects performance and is an important metric that decides tire replacement, one of the biggest maintenance expense of the global trucking industry. We believe that it is important to measure and monitor tire wear in all automobiles. Current approach to measure tire wear is manual and extremely tedious. Embedding sensor electronics in tires to measure tire wear is challenging, given the inhospitable temperature, pressure and dynamics of the tire. Further, off-tire sensors placed in the well such as laser range-finders are vulnerable to road debris that may settle in tire grooves.This paper presents Osprey, the first on-automobile, mmWave sensing system that can measure accurate tire wear continuously and is robust to road debris. Osprey's key innovation is to leverage existing, high volume, automobile mmWave RADAR, place it in the tire well of automobiles and observe reflections of the RADAR's signal from the tire surface and grooves to measure tire wear, even in the presence of debris. We achieve this through a super-resolution Inverse Synthetic Aperture RADAR algorithm that exploits the natural rotation of the tire and improves range resolution to sub-mm. We show how our system can eliminate debris by attaching specialized metallic structures in the grooves that behave as spatial codes and offer a unique signature, when coupled with the rotation of the tire. In addition to tire wear sensing, we demonstrate the ability to detect and locate unsafe, metallic foreign objects such as nails lodged in the tire.We evaluate Osprey on commercial tires mounted on mechanical, tire-rotation rig and passenger car. We test Osprey at different speeds, in the presence of different types of debris, different levels of debris, on different terrains, and different levels of automobile vibration. We achieve a median absolute tire wear error of 0.68 mm across all our experiments. Osprey also locates foreign objects lodged in the tire with an error of 1.7 cm and detects metallic foreign objects with an accuracy of 92%.",

The prototype is specifically designed to be mounted on the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) buses. Movement of the buses adds noise to pollution data. Error in GPS measurement causes issues in detecting moving vs. stationary state of the buses, useful to filter out noisy pollution data collected in the moving state. Intermittent cellular network connectivity causes frequent disconnects with the remote server. Our prototype is designed to handle such real world deployment challenges. Pilot deployment with this platform is currently ongoing. Preliminary data analysis from the pilot deployment will be discussed as part of the poster presentation, along with demonstration of the prototype sensor platform. This hardware prototype has the potential of creating locality wise, dense air pollution data providing crucial insights into the causes of air pollution.",

                    "abstract": "Mobile vision systems would benefit from the ability to situationally sacrifice image resolution to save system energy when imaging detail is unnecessary. Unfortunately, any change in sensor resolution leads to a substantial pause in frame delivery -- as much as 280 ms. Frame delivery is bottlenecked by a sequence of reconfiguration procedures and memory management in current operating systems before it resumes at the new resolution. This latency from reconfiguration impedes the adoption of otherwise beneficial resolution-energy tradeoff mechanisms. We propose Banner as a media framework that provides a rapid sensor resolution reconfiguration service as a modification to common media frameworks, e.g., V4L2. Banner completely eliminates the frame-to-frame reconfiguration latency (226 ms to 33 ms), i.e., removing the frame drop during sensor resolution reconfiguration. Banner also halves the end-to-end resolution reconfiguration latency (226 ms to 105 ms). This enables a more than 49% reduction of system power consumption by allowing continuous vision applications to reconfigure the sensor resolution to 480p compared with downsampling from 1080p to 480p, as measured in a cloud-based offloading workload running on a Jetson TX2 board. As a result, Banner unlocks unprecedented capabilities for mobile vision applications to dynamically reconfigure sensor resolutions to balance the energy efficiency and task accuracy tradeoff.",

However, the current wearable programming model requires the developer to write a custom companion app for each wearable form factor; the companion app extends the smartphone display onto the wearable, relays user interactions from the wearable to the phone, and updates the wearable display as needed. The development effort required to write a companion app is significant and will not scale to an increasing diversity of form factors. This paper argues for a different programming model for wearable devices. The developer writes an application for the smartphone, but only specifies a UI design for the wearable. Our UIWear system abstracts a logical model of the smartphone GUI, re-tailors the GUI for the wearable device based on the specified UI design, and compiles it into a companion app that we call the UICompanion app. We implemented UIWear on Android smartphones, AndroidWear smartwatches, and Sony SmartEyeGlasses. We evaluate 20 developer-written companion apps from the AndroidWear category on Google Play against the UIWear-created UICompanion apps. The lines-of-code required for the developer to specify the UI design in UIWear is an order-of-magnitude smaller compared to the companion app lines-of-code. Further, in most cases, the UICompanion app performed comparably or better than the corresponding companion app both in terms of qualitative metrics, including latency and energy, and quantitative metrics, including look-and-feel.",

Through a MIMO array of phased arrays with hundreds of antenna elements, mmWave can boost wireless bit-rates to 100+ Gbps, and potentially achieve near-vision sensing resolution. However, the lack of an experimental platform has been impeding research in this field. We propose to fill the gap with M3 (M-Cube), the first mmWave massive MIMO software radio. M3 features a fully reconfigurable array of phased arrays, with up to 8 RF chains and 256 antenna elements. Despite the orders of magnitude larger antenna arrays, its cost is orders of magnitude lower, even when compared with state-of-the-art single RF chain mmWave software radios. In this demo, we will show M3's hardware modules, and demonstrate its usage in mmWave MIMO communication and sensing.",

The Internet has played a key role in helping us deal with the coronavirus pandemic, a recent black swan event. However, Internet researchers and operators are mostly blind to another black swan event that poses a direct threat to Internet infrastructure. In this paper, we investigate the impact of solar superstorms that can potentially cause large-scale Internet outages covering the entire globe and lasting several months. We discuss the challenges posed by such activity and currently available mitigation techniques. Using real-world datasets, we analyze the robustness of the current Internet infrastructure and show that submarine cables are at greater risk of failure compared to land cables. Moreover, the US has a higher risk for disconnection compared to Asia. Finally, we lay out steps for improving the Internet's resiliency.",

Current approaches are cumbersome, susceptible to eavesdropping and relay attacks, or energy inefficient. In this paper, we propose a body-guided communication mechanism to secure every touch when users interact with a variety of devices and objects. The method is implemented in a hardware token worn on user's body, for example in the form of a wristband, which interacts with a receiver embedded inside the touched device through a body-guided channel established when the user touches the device. Experiments show low-power (uJ/bit) operation while achieving superior resilience to attacks, with the received signal at the intended receiver through the body channel being at least 20dB higher than that of an adversary in cm range.",

However, there has been little exploration into the performance and energy trade-offs mobile GPUs can deliver for the increasingly popular workload of deep-inference audio sensing tasks, such as, spoken keyword spotting in energy-constrained smartphones and wearables. In this paper, we study these trade-offs and introduce an optimization engine that leverages a series of structural and memory access optimization techniques that allow audio algorithm performance to be automatically tuned as a function of GPU device specifications and model semantics. We find that parameter optimized audio routines obtain inferences an order of magnitude faster than sequential CPU implementations, and up to 6.5x times faster than cloud offloading with good connectivity, while critically consuming 3-4x less energy than the CPU. Under our optimized GPU, conventional wisdom about how to use the cloud and low power chips is broken. Unless the network has a throughput of at least 20Mbps (and a RTT of 25 ms or less), with only about 10 to 20 seconds of buffering audio data for batched execution, the optimized GPU audio sensing apps begin to consume less energy than cloud offloading. Under such conditions we find the optimized GPU can provide energy benefits comparable to low-power reference DSP implementations with some preliminary level of optimization; in addition to the GPU always winning with lower latency.",

Unfortunately, existing reconfiguration frameworks often fall short in practice as they either only support a small set of reconfiguration scenarios or simply do not scale.We address these problems with Snowcap, the first network reconfiguration framework which can synthesize configuration updates that comply with arbitrary hard and soft specifications, and involve arbitrary routing protocols. Our key contribution is an efficient search procedure which leverages counter-examples to efficiently navigate the space of configuration updates. Given a reconfiguration ordering which violates the desired specifications, our algorithm automatically identifies the problematic commands so that it can avoid this particular order in the next iteration.We fully implemented Snowcap and extensively evaluated its scalability and effectiveness on real-world topologies and typical, large-scale reconfiguration scenarios. Even for large topologies, Snowcap finds a valid reconfiguration ordering with minimal side-effects (i.e., traffic shifts) within a few seconds at most.",

                    "abstract": "Device to Device (D2D) communication is one of the key enhancement of Long-Term Evolution (LTE) Advanced standard which is a precursor to fifth generation (5G) cellular standard. D2D has gained considerable attention due to several drawbacks associated with the existing mobile networks such as multi-hop transmission, higher latency, high power consumption and significant path loss. In an underlay D2D communication, both cellular and D2D users coexist by simultaneously sharing the licensed cellular spectrum. However, the performance of an underlay D2D communication is limited by the amount of interference from the cellular user(CU) to the D2D user and vice versa. In this paper, we design and develop a test-bed to evaluate the real-world performance of the underlay D2D communication framework. We demonstrate the impact of interference caused by CU on D2D receiver's throughput at different cellular angles and position with respect to the base station (BS). The demonstration has been performed on National Instruments Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) RIO platform with LTE application framework module of LabVIEW communication system design suite as a supportive Application programming interface (API).",

This demo brings forward a concept of 'communication is sensing', which is to make sense of the world purely based on communication carrier rather than specialized sensors. In this demo, we present an RFID-based solution, called Tagbeat, to inspect mechanical vibration using COTS RFID tags and readers. We implement our system using a COTS RFID device and evaluate it with a commercial centrifugal machine. Empirical benchmarks with a prototype show that our system can inspect the vibration period with a mean accuracy of 0.36ms and a relative error rate of 0.03%.",

The existing approaches of parallel backscatter are based on a common assumption, i.e. the states of the collided signals are distinguishable from each other in either the time domain or the IQ (the In-phase and Quadrature) domain. We in this paper disclose the superclustering phenomenon, which invalidates that assumption and seriously affects the decoding performance. Then we propose an interstellar travelling model to capture the bursty Gaussian process of a collided signal. Based on this model, we design Hubble, a reliable signal processing approach to support parallel backscatter in the wild. Hubble addresses several technical challenges: (i) a novel scheme based on Pearson's Chi-Square test to extract the collided signals' combined states, (ii) a Markov driven method to capture the law of signal state transitions, and (iii) error correction schemes to guarantee the reliability of parallel decoding. Theoretically, Hubble is able to decode all the backscattered data, as long as the signals are detectable by the receiver. The experiment results demonstrate that the median throughput of Hubble is $11.7times$ higher than that of the state-of-the-art approach.",

Recovering from severe stress to a normal state is much easier, in terms of the length of time and treatment required, compared to when more serious conditions have manifested [1]. Unfortunately, existing stress monitoring applications either require dedicated applications to be installed on the user's mobile device or use various mobile and wearable sensors [2, 4, 6, 7]; thus are not scalable to large number of users. Our goal is to provide a community-wide \"safety net\" that will automatically and non-intrusively detect individuals exhibiting signs of excessive stress without them installing any dedicated app. YouTube Demo Link https://youtu.be/LKQvIX4W6L0",

We propose Empath-D, a system that fosters empathetic design, by allowing app designers, in-situ, to rapidly evaluate the usability of their apps, from the perspective of impaired users. To provide a truly authentic experience, Empath-D carefully orchestrates the interaction between a smartphone and a VR device, allowing the user to experience simulated impairments in a virtual world while interacting naturally with the app, using a real smartphone. By carefully orchestrating the VR-smartphone interaction, Empath-D tackles challenges such as preserving low-latency app interaction, accurate visualization of hand movement and low-overhead perturbation of I/O streams. Experimental results show that user interaction with Empath-D is comparable (both in accuracy and user perception) to real-world app usage, and that it can simulate impairment effects as effectively as a custom hardware simulator.",

High-quality VR systems generate graphics data at a data rate much higher than those supported by existing wireless-communication products such as Wi-Fi and 60GHz wireless communication. The necessary image encoding, makes it challenging to maintain the stringent VR latency requirements. To achieve the required latency, our system employs a Parallel Rendering and Streaming mechanism to reduce the add-on streaming latency, by pipelining the rendering, encoding, transmission and decoding procedures. Furthermore, we introduce a Remote VSync Driven Rendering technique to minimize display latency. To evaluate the system, we implement an end-to-end remote rendering platform on commodity hardware over a 60Ghz wireless network. Results show that the system can support current 2160x1200 VR resolution at 90Hz with less than 16ms end-to-end latency, and 4K resolution with 20ms latency, while keeping a visually lossless image quality to the user.",

One of the key limiting factors is the lack of adequate broadband connectivity, which limits agencies' capabilities to (i) disseminate emergency preparedness and response information to residents and (ii) efficiently coordinate in the face of a disaster. In this demo, we present the EApp; a smartphone application that strives to improve the information access regarding emergencies for rural residents and first responders.",

However, such convenience also makes personal video clips easily obtained and exploited by malicious users who launch scam attacks. Existing studies only deal with the attacks that use fabricated facial masks, while the liveness detection that targets the playback attacks using a virtual camera is still elusive. In this work, we develop a novel video chat liveness detection system, which can track the weak light changes reflected off the skin of a human face leveraging chromatic eigenspace differences. We design an inconspicuous challenge frame with minimal intervention to the video chat and develop a robust anomaly frame detector to verify the liveness of remote user in a video chat session. Furthermore, we propose a resilient defense strategy to defeat both naive and intelligent playback attacks leveraging spatial and temporal verification. The evaluation results show that our system can achieve accurate and robust liveness detection with the accuracy and false detection rate as high as 97.7% (94.8%) and 1% (1.6%) on smartphones (laptops), respectively.",

To achieve high throughput and low latency, state-of-the-art algorithms strive to fit the rule lookup data structures into on-die caches; however, they do not scale well with the number of rules.We present a novel approach, NuevoMatch, which improves the memory scaling of existing methods. A new data structure, Range Query Recursive Model Index (RQ-RMI), is the key component that enables NuevoMatch to replace most of the accesses to main memory with model inference computations. We describe an efficient training algorithm that guarantees the correctness of the RQ-RMI-based classification. The use of RQ-RMI allows the rules to be compressed into model weights that fit into the hardware cache. Further, it takes advantage of the growing support for fast neural network processing in modern CPUs, such as wide vector instructions, achieving a rate of tens of nanoseconds per lookup.Our evaluation using 500K multi-field rules from the standard ClassBench benchmark shows a geometric mean compression factor of 4.9x, 8x, and 82x, and average performance improvement of 2.4x, 2.6x, and 1.6x in throughput compared to CutSplit, NeuroCuts, and TupleMerge, all state-of-the-art algorithms1.",

This paper presents an accurate model-based device-free localization system LiFS, implemented on cheap commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi devices. Unlike previous COTS device-based work, LiFS is able to localize a target accurately without offline training. The basic idea is simple: channel state information (CSI) is sensitive to a target's location and by modelling the CSI measurements of multiple wireless links as a set of power fading based equations, the target location can be determined. However, due to rich multipath propagation indoors, the received signal strength (RSS) or even the fine-grained CSI can not be easily modelled. We observe that even in a rich multipath environment, not all subcarriers are affected equally by multipath reflections. Our pre-processing scheme tries to identify the subcarriers not affected by multipath. Thus, CSIs on the \"clean\" subcarriers can be utilized for accurate localization.We design, implement and evaluate LiFS with extensive experiments in three different environments. Without knowing the majority transceivers' locations, LiFS achieves a median accuracy of 0.5 m and 1.1 m in line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art systems. Besides single target localization, LiFS is able to differentiate two sparsely-located targets and localize each of them at a high accuracy.",

With the advent of wearables and the Internet of Things (IoT), Bluetooth has again gained importance, which makes security research and protocol optimizations imperative. Surprisingly, there is a lack of openly available tools and experimental platforms to scrutinize Bluetooth. In particular, system aspects and close to hardware protocol layers are mostly uncovered. We reverse engineer multiple Broadcom Bluetooth chipsets that are widespread in off-the-shelf devices. Thus, we offer deep insights into the internal architecture of a popular commercial family of Bluetooth controllers used in smartphones, wearables, and IoT platforms. Reverse engineered functions can then be altered with our InternalBlue Python framework---outperforming evaluation kits, which are limited to documented and vendor-defined functions. The modified Bluetooth stack remains fully functional and high-performance. Hence, it provides a portable low-cost research platform. InternalBlue is a versatile framework and we demonstrate its abilities by implementing tests and demos for known Bluetooth vulnerabilities. Moreover, we discover a novel critical security issue affecting a large selection of Broadcom chipsets that allows executing code within the attacked Bluetooth firmware. We further show how to use our framework to fix bugs in chipsets out of vendor support and how to add new security features to Bluetooth firmware.",

We show that networking this small number of nearby sites with each other is a surprisingly challenging and multi-faceted problem. We draw out the operational goals and constraints of such networks, and highlight the design trade-offs involved using data from Microsoft Azure's regions.Our analysis of the design space shows that network topologies that achieve lower latency and allow greater flexibility in data center placement are, unfortunately, encumbered by their much greater cost and complexity. We thus present and demonstrate a novel optical-circuit-switched architecture, Iris, that lowers these cost and complexity barriers, making a richer topology design space more accessible to operators of regional networks. With Iris, topologies which, in comparison to a simple hub-and-spoke topology can increase the area in which a new DC can be placed by 2-5x, can be implemented at a cost within 1.1x of the simple hub-and-spoke topology, and 7x cheaper than a natural packet-switched network.",

A common assumption is that the adversary is equipped with only a single device from which it transmits location spoofing signals. In this paper, we consider a more advanced model where the attacker is equipped with multiple devices and performs a geographically distributed coordinated attack on the multilateration system. The feasibility of a distributed multi-device attack is demonstrated experimentally with a self-developed attack implementation based on multiple COTS software-defined radio (SDR) devices. We launch an attack against the OpenSky Network, an air traffic surveillance system that implements a time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) multi-lateration method for aircraft localization based on ADS-B signals. Our experiments show that the timing errors for distributed spoofed signals are indistinguishable from the multilateration errors of legitimate aircraft signals, indicating that the threat of multi-device spoofing attacks is real in this and other similar systems. In the second part of this work, we investigate physical-layer features that could be used to detect multi-device attacks. We show that the frequency offset and transient phase noise of the attacker's radio devices can be exploited to discriminate between a received signal that has been transmitted by a single (legitimate) transponder or by multiple (malicious) spoofing sources. Based on that, we devise a multi-device spoofing detection system that achieves zero false positives and a false negative rate below 1%.",

The traditional approach to implementing this type of behavior is through a control plane that is orders of magnitude slower than the speed at which typical data center congestion events occur. More recent alternatives like programmable switches can remember statistics about passing traffic and adjust behavior accordingly, but unfortunately, their capabilities severely limit what can be done.In this paper, we present Mantis, a framework for implementing fine-grained reactive behavior on today's programmable switches with the help of a specialized reactive control plane architecture. Mantis is, thus, a combination of language for specifying dynamic components of packet processing and an optimized, general, and safe control loop for implementing them. Mantis provides a simple-to-reason-about set of abstractions for users, and the Mantis control plane can react to changes in the network in 10s of \u03bcs.",

Full-Duplex has the potential to double the available capacity in the mm-wave bands by enabling simultaneous radio transmission and reception. While full-duplex has been extensively studied in sub-6 GHz bands, this paper exposes the unique challenges in porting this capability to mm-wave frequencies.We present mmFD, the first comprehensive system design of a mm-wave full-duplex platform. mmFD achieves large self-interference cancellation through novel designs at the antenna, analog and digital frontends. We exploit the small wavelength of mm-wave to achieve strong signal isolation between transmit and receive antennas. We further build a custom IC that achieves high-bandwidth analog cancellation at mm-wave frequencies. Finally, we present digital self-interference cancellation algorithms that address the unique hardware impairments observed at mm-wave frequencies. A detailed evaluation of mmFD demonstrates 84 dB of cancellation and 1.7X throughput gain over equivalent half-duplex systems in rich indoor settings.",

Meanwhile, the growing adoption of sensors in wearables also provides opportunities to capture novel wearable biometrics. In this work, we propose EarDynamic, an ear canal deformation based user authentication using ear wearables (earables). EarDynamic provides continuous and passive user authentication and is transparent to users. It leverages ear canal deformation that combines the unique static geometry and dynamic motions of the ear canal when the user is speaking for authentication. It utilizes an acoustic sensing approach to capture the ear canal deformation with the built-in microphone and speaker of the earables. Specifically, it first emits well-designed inaudible beep signals and records the reflected signals from the ear canal. It then analyzes the reflected signals and extracts fine-grained acoustic features that correspond to the ear canal deformation for user authentication. Our experimental evaluation shows that EarDynamic can achieve a recall of 97.38% and an F1 score of 96.84%.",

This paper introduces RetroI2V - a novel infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) communication and networking system that renovates conventional road signs to convey additional and dynamic information to vehicles while keeping intact their original functionality. In particular, RetroI2V exploits the retroreflective coating of road signs and establishes visible light backscattering communication (VLBC), and further coordinates multiple concurrent VLBC sessions among road signs and approaching vehicles. RetroI2V features a suite of novel VLBC designs including late-polarization, complementary optical signaling and polarization-based differential reception which are crucial to avoid flickering and achieve long VLBC range, as well as a decentralized MAC protocol that make practical multiple access in highly mobile and transient I2V settings. Experimental results from our prototyped system show that RetroI2V supports up to 101 m communication range and efficient multiple access at scale.",

Existing gas monitoring approaches such as the use of catalytic and infrared sensors and electrochemical and metal oxide semiconductor technologies, typically require expensive hardware or are power hungry, and thus not suitable for long-term and large scale deployments. We propose a gas intensity measuring system with cost-effective commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) RFID devices. Our key intuition is that the changes in phase and strength of the signal result from not only the signal propagation but also from the hardware (i.e., tag's circuit). To this end, we propose a method to in- tegrate RFID with a chemiresistor, called Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs), whose electrical property varies with the nearby gas concentration. Our system shows the potential of low-cost, easy-to-make, and wireless sensing based gas monitoring systems.",

Most of the time, location, device, and app information are linked to the same device using a unique advertising ID (Ad ID). If the Ad ID is not available, advertisers can still use geo-coordinates or IP address to infer links in data gathered from different ad placements.Even though the Ad ID can be disabled by users on both OSes, we demonstrate that advertisers can leave their own unique strings (marks) in the app storage, and use these strings to link information collected from ads. Users cannot clear these marks without losing all data within the app. Because advertising platforms allow connection filtering and geofencing, users who either connect using a non-cellular IP address or allow location access to the app are substantially easier to be rediscovered by the advertiser.We carried out many large-scale experiments on iOS and Android devices involving hundreds of thousands of impressions. We found that on average 49% of impressions from an iOS device, and 59% of Android impressions could be re-identified for less than $5/day per device using this strategy. We subsequently verified this method on 1,727 devices and recovered 660 of them within 48 hours for $86.73. Finally, we explore the behavior of privacy-seeking VPN users. We found that for the majority, their clearnet IP address and location could be unmasked easily using ads.",

An adversary could leverage the attack to disable the VCS user's home security system, leak the victim's privacy or download malware stealthily. Efforts have been dedicated to developing forensics based defense mechanisms, which target at detecting traces of the attack signal; however, we find that existing approaches of the kind still leave loopholes. Moreover, a complete defense mechanism should be able to not only detect the attack but also cancel out the attack signal, and meanwhile ensure the legitimate voice commands unaffected, which however is still unavailable to the best of our knowledge. This paper is an attempt to fill the gap. We first systematically analyze existing forensics based defense mechanisms and reveal the root cause of their loopholes. Then we present an active inaudible-voice-command cancellation (AIC) design, which can reliably detect and capture the attack signal facilitated by our custom-designed \"guard'' signal transmitter. AIC can create a special spectrum in the passband of the VCS microphone, based on which we are able to neutralize the attack signal in software means. We implement a prototype of our defense system and conduct comprehensive experiments to validate our design.",

                    "abstract": "The growing trend of multi-device ownerships creates a need and an opportunity to use applications across multiple devices. However, in general, the current app development and usage still remain within the single-device paradigm, falling far short of user expectations. For example, it is currently not possible for a user to dynamically partition an existing live streaming app with chatting capabilities across different devices, such that she watches her favorite broadcast on her smart TV while real-time chatting on her smartphone. In this paper, we present FLUID, a new Android-based multi-device platform that enables innovative ways of using multiple devices. FLUID aims to i) allow users to migrate or replicate individual user interfaces (UIs) of a single app on multiple devices (high flexibility), ii) require no additional development effort to support unmodified, legacy applications (ease of development), and iii) support a wide range of apps that follow the trend of using custom-made UIs (wide applicability). Previous approaches, such as screen mirroring, app migration, and customized apps utilizing multiple devices, do not satisfy those goals altogether. FLUID, on the other hand, meets the goals by carefully analyzing which UI states are necessary to correctly render UI objects, deploying only those states on different devices, supporting cross-device function calls transparently, and synchronizing the UI states of replicated UI objects across multiple devices. Our evaluation with 20 unmodified, real-world Android apps shows that FLUID can transparently support a wide range of apps and is fast enough for interactive use.",

This demo is the first to show that ultra-high radio frequency identification signals can be received by an AM radio receiver due to the presence of the nonlinearity effect in the AM receiver. Such a phenomenon allows the development of a previously infeasible cross-technology communication, called Tagcaster, which converts an ETC reader to an AM station for broadcasting short messages (e.g, charged-fees and traffic forecast) to drivers at tollbooths. The prototype of Tagcaster is designed, implemented and evaluated over four general and five vehicle-mounted AM receivers (e.g, Toyota, Audi, and Jetta). Experiments reveal that Tagcaster can provide good-quality (PESQ&gt;2) and stable AM broadcasting service with a 30m coverage range.",

The high relative bandwidth cost, poor network performance, and lack of relevant local content combine to dampen the demand for the Internet and services it enables. In this paper we propose GAIUS, a content ecosystem enabling efficient creation and dissemination of locally relevant web content. At its core, GAIUS consists of the following innovations: a locally sustainable content ecosystem, and MAML, a web specification language that simplifies web pages to reduce costs and lower barriers for content creation.",

                    "abstract": "The number of smartphone users globally has already exceeded 2 Billion, and this number is expected to reach 3 Billion by 2020 [2]. It is also estimated that smartphone mobile data traffic (cellular + WiFi) will reach 370 Exabytes per year by that time, exceeding PC Internet traffic the first time in the history [4].An average smartphone consumes between 300 -- 1200 milliwatts power [1] depending on the type of applications it is running, and most of the energy in smartphone applications is spent for networked I/O. During an active data transfer, the cellular (i.e., GSM) and WiFi components of a smartphone consume more power than its CPU, RAM, and even LCD+graphics card at the highest brightness level [3,1]. Although the mobile data traffic and the amount of energy spent for it increase at a very fast pace, the battery capacities of smartphones do not increase at the same rate.In this work, we analyze the effects of different application layer data transfer protocol parameters (such as the number of parallel data streams per file, the level of concurrent file transfers, and the I/O request size) on mobile data transfer throughput and energy consumption.Figure 1 shows the achieved end-to-end throughput, total energy consumption, and the change in instantaneous power consumption during a wide-area data transfer with increased concurrency level. This figure presents the break point for the throughput versus energy consumption trade-off very well. As long as the energy gain due to the decreased transfer time is more than the loss due to the increased instantaneous power consumption, then we save energy at this device while increasing the throughput. But this is not always the case. We observe that although the throughput continues to increase up to a certain concurrency level, the total energy consumption does not continue to decrease, instead comes to a balance and starts increasing again. The main reason for this is the server and network components are typically not energy proportional.When used wisely, these parameters have a potential to improve the end-to-end data transfer performance and decrease total energy consumption at a great extent, but improper use of these parameters can also hurt the performance of the data transfers due to increased load at the end-systems and congested links in the network. For this reason, it is crucial to find the best combination for these parameters with the least intrusion and overhead to the system resource utilization and power consumption.Our contributions within this work are the following: (1) To the best of our knowledge, we are first to provide an in depth analysis of the effects of application layer data transfer protocol parameters on the energy consumption of mobile phones. (2) We show that significant energy savings can be achieved with application-layer solutions at the mobile systems during data transfer with no or minimal performance penalty. (3) We also show that, in many cases, performance increase and energy savings can be achieved simultaneously.",

While many RSS-based device-free localization systems can detect a line crossing, this system estimates additionally the speed of crossing, which can provide significant additional information to a tracking system. Further, unlike device-free RF sensors which occupy tens of MHz of bandwidth, this system uses a channel of about 10 kHz. Experiments with a person walking from 0.3 to 1.8 m/s show the system can measure walking speed within 0.05 m/s RMS error.",

                    "abstract": "IoT and deep learning based computer vision together create an immense market opportunity, but running deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained IoT devices remains challenging. Offloading DNN inference to an edge server is a promising solution, but limited wireless bandwidth bottlenecks its end-to-end performance and scalability. While IoT devices can adopt source compression to cope with the limited bandwidth, existing compression algorithms (or codecs) are not designed for DNN (but for human eyes), and thus, suffer from either low compression rates or high DNN inference errors. This paper presents GRACE, a DNN-aware compression algorithm that facilitates the edge inference by significantly saving the network bandwidth consumption without disturbing the inference performance. Given a target DNN, GRACE (i) analyzes DNN's perception model w.r.t both spatial frequencies and colors and (ii) generates an optimized compression strategy for the model -- one-time offline process. Next, GRACE deploys thus-generated compression strategy at IoT devices (or source) to perform online source compression within the existing codec framework, adding no extra overhead. We prototype GRACE on JPEG (the most popular image codec framework), and our evaluation results show that GRACE indeed achieves the superior compression performance over existing strategies for key DNN applications. For semantic segmentation tasks, GRACE reduces a source size by 23% compared to JPEG with similar interference accuracy (0.38% lower than GRACE). Further, GRACE even achieves 7.5% higher inference accuracy than JPEG with a commonly used quality level of 75 does. For classification tasks, GRACE reduces the bandwidth consumption by 90% over JPEG with the same inference accuracy.",

In these cases, devices in close proximity are deemed trustworthy while more distant devices are viewed as potential adversaries. Because radio waves are invisible, however, a user may believe a wireless device is communicating with a nearby device when in fact the user's device is communicating with a distant adversary. Researchers have previously proposed methods for multi-antenna devices to ascertain physical proximity with other devices, but devices with a single antenna, such as those commonly used in the Internet of Things, cannot take advantage of these techniques. We investigate a method for a single-antenna Wi-Fi device to quickly determine proximity with another Wi-Fi device. Our approach leverages the repeating nature Wi-Fi's preamble and the characteristics of a transmitting antenna's near field to detect proximity with high probability. Our method never falsely declares proximity at ranges longer than 14 cm.",

Stability of signal strength is a critical factor of wireless indoor localization for higher accuracy. While traditional methods like trilateration and fingerprinting suffer from noise and packet loss, deep learning based methods perform well. We focus on large-scale exhibition where wireless signal gets unstable due to many people. Proposed neural network consists of fully connected layers for noise removal and LSTM layers for time-series feature extraction. The network takes the time-series of signal strength as input and outputs the estimated location. In the evaluation, the number of layers is changed to find the optimal structure. As a result, the best configuration achieved the error of 2.44m at 75 percentile for the data of a large-scale exhibition in Tokyo.",

                    "abstract": "Network analytics are widely used in many fields. Increasingly though, the networks of interest are high dimensional. Rather than just focusing on the traditional who is interaction with whom networks, modern network analysis examines the who, what, where, when and why ecology of relations. For example, studies of organizations might look at the social network within the organization as well as the task assignment and knowledge network. Studies using Twitter frequently look at the mentions network at the same time as the hashtag network. Making network science actionable typically involves answering questions about where the network is concentrated or how the network varies over time. This tutorial will cover the basics of Network analytics and demonstrate the use of ORA to support social media analytics using high dimensional network analytics and visualization for social media networks, semantic networks, geo-spatial networks, and dynamic networks. It will cover the basics of visualizing and analyzing time varying networks and spatially positioned networks.

                    "abstract": "WiFi based gesture recognition systems have recently proliferated due to the ubiquitous availability of WiFi in almost every modern building. The key limitation of existing WiFi based gesture recognition systems is that they require the user to be in the same configuration (i.e., at the same position and in same orientation) when performing gestures at runtime as when providing training samples, which significantly restricts their practical usability. In this paper, we propose a WiFi based gesture recognition system, namely WiAG, which recognizes the gestures of the user irrespective of his/her configuration. The key idea behind WiAG is that it first requests the user to provide training samples for all gestures in only one configuration and then automatically generates virtual samples for all gestures in all possible configurations by applying our novel translation function on the training samples. Next, for each configuration, it generates a classification model using virtual samples corresponding to that configuration. To recognize gestures of a user at runtime, as soon as the user performs a gesture, WiAG first automatically estimates the configuration of the user and then evaluates the gesture against the classification model corresponding to that estimated configuration. Our evaluation results show that when user's configuration is not the same at runtime as at the time of providing training samples, WiAG significantly improves the gesture recognition accuracy from just 51.4% to 91.4%.",

However, almost all existing works (e.g., based on cellphones, onboard devices, or traffic cameras) suffer from high costs, low penetration rates, or only aggregate results. To address these drawbacks, we utilize Electric Toll Collection systems (ETC) as a large-scale sensor network and design a system called VeMo to transparently model and predict vehicle mobility at the individual level with a full penetration rate. Our novelty is how we address uncertainty issues (i.e., unknown routes and speeds) due to sparse implicit ETC data based on a key data-driven insight, i.e., individual driving behaviors are strongly correlated with crowds of drivers under certain spatiotemporal contexts and can be predicted by combining both personal habits and context information. More importantly, we evaluate VeMo with (i) a large-scale ETC system with tracking devices at 773 highway entrances and exits capturing more than 2 million vehicles every day; (ii) a fleet consisting of 114 thousand vehicles with GPS data as ground truth. We compared VeMo with state-of-the-art benchmark mobility models, and the experimental results show that VeMo outperforms them by average 10% in terms of accuracy.",

Sonoloc enables users to address each other based on their relative positions at events like meetings, talks, or conferences. This capability can, for instance, aid spontaneous communication among users based on their relative position (e.g., in a given section of a room, at the same table, or in a given seat), facilitate interaction between speaker and audience in a lecture hall, and enable the distribution of materials, crowdsensing, and feedback collection based on users' location. Sonoloc can position any number of devices within acoustic range with a constant number of chirps emitted by a self-organized subset of devices. Our experimental evaluation shows that the system can locate up to hundreds of devices with an accuracy of tens of centimeters using up to 15 audio chirps emitted by dynamically selected devices, in actual rooms and despite substantial background noise.",

However, existing methods of video delivery fall short of delivering high-quality video. Recent advances in neural super-resolution have opened up the possibility of enhancing video quality by leveraging client-side computation. Unfortunately, mobile devices cannot benefit from this because it is too expensive in computation and power-hungry.To overcome the limitation, we present NEMO, a system that enables real-time video super-resolution on mobile devices. NEMO applies neural super-resolution to a few select frames and transfers the outputs to benefit the remaining frames. The frames to which super-resolution is applied are carefully chosen to maximize the overall quality gains. NEMO leverages fine-grained dependencies using information from the video codec and strives to provide guarantees in the quality degradation compared to per-frame super-resolution. Our evaluation using a full system implementation on Android shows NEMO improves the overall processing throughput by x11.5, reduces energy consumption by 88.6%, and maintains device temperatures at acceptable levels compared to per-frame super-resolution, while ensuring high video quality. Overall, this leads to a 31.2% improvement in quality of experience for mobile users.",

Especially, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors are widely used to obtain dataset to train ML models for human activity recognition. A key challenge in building highly accurate ML models lies in collecting a wide variety of activity data from a large number of users. Such data collection is often a highly time-consuming and costly process.",

                    "abstract": "Writing packet-processing programs for programmable switch pipelines is challenging because of their all-or-nothing nature: a program either runs at line rate if it can fit within pipeline resources, or does not run at all. It is the compiler's responsibility to fit programs into pipeline resources. However, switch compilers, which use rewrite rules to generate switch machine code, often reject programs because the rules fail to transform programs into a form that can be mapped to a pipeline's limited resources---even if a mapping actually exists.This paper presents a compiler, Chipmunk, which formulates code generation as a program synthesis problem. Chipmunk uses a program synthesis engine, SKETCH, to transform high-level programs down to switch machine code. However, naively formulating code generation as program synthesis can lead to long compile times. Hence, we develop a new domain-specific synthesis technique, slicing, which reduces compile times by 1-387x and 51x on average.Using a switch hardware simulator, we show that Chipmunk compiles many programs that a previous rule-based compiler, Domino, rejects. Chipmunk also produces machine code with fewer pipeline stages than Domino. A Chipmunk backend for the Tofino programmable switch shows that program synthesis can produce machine code for high-speed switches.",

This work demonstrates a serious security breach and aims to raise the awareness of the public that the passcodes for authorizing transactions in mobile payments can be leaked by exploiting the embedded sensors in wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches). We present a passcode inference system, which examines to what extent the user's PIN during mobile payment could be revealed from a single wrist-worn wearable device under different input scenarios involving either two hands or a single hand. Extensive experiments with 15 volunteers demonstrate that an adversary is able to recover a user's PIN with high success rate within 5 tries under various input scenarios.",

                    "abstract": "We aimed at implementing an indoor dialog agent, namely PhoenixBot, working in a mixed-reality environment. The agent occupies a certain position in a real-world space, and interacts with other nearby human.We developed a server that maintains information of agents and smartphone users, where the information includes current indoor position and direction. We also developed an Android application as a client, which collects real-time data from various sensors such as gyroscope, accelerometer, step detector, WiFi, magnetic field, and gravity sensor. The step detector values and WiFi signals are used to estimate the current location of the user, and the other remaining sensors are used to compute the user direction. The client application displays the real-world scene covered with some virtual objects (e.g., agent, board), as depicted in Fig. 1, where the cartoon character at the center is the dialog agent. In order to compute the right position to display the components, the client keeps consistent information of the virtual objects with the server. That is, if a user moves to other position, then it will be reported to the server and will be disclosed to the other agents and users. The dialog agent works in the way similar to other dialog agents, as it has a pipeline of modules such as Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Dialog Management (DM), and Natural Language Generation (NLG). The agent currently supports four domains: weather, campus, transport, and bible. The agent speaks only Korean for now, but will be portable to other langauges if a dataset for the target language is prepared. You can see the video clip at https://youtu.be/U2FA-XxVPvM",

Delivering VR content over a wireless link is challenging due to the high data rates and stringent time delivery requirements. Millimeter wave communication at 60 GHz (WiGig) can meet these requirements, but, it is unreliable due to blockages and beam misalignments. In this poster, we present an idea of using both WiFi and WiGig interfaces to transmit the VR content. We divide a video frame into tiles and prioritize the tiles in the user's field of view. Based on the wireless link conditions, the tiles are encoded with varying qualities and transmitted over either WiFi or WiGig interface. We formulate an optimization framework to deliver the VR video with high reliability and low latency.",

They peer to other IPX-Ps and form the IPX network, which interconnects 800 MNOs worldwide offering their customers access to mobile services in any other country. Despite the importance of IPX-Ps, little is known about their operations and performance. In this paper, we shed light on these opaque providers by analyzing a large IPX-P with more than 100 PoPs in 40+ countries, with a particularly strong presence in America and Europe. Specifically, we characterize the traffic and performance of the main infrastructures of the IPX-P (i.e., 2-3-4G signaling and GTP tunneling), and provide implications for its operation, as well as for the IPX-P's customers. Our analysis is based on statistics we collected during two time periods (i.e., prior and during COVID-19 pandemic) and includes insights on the main service the platform supports (i.e., IoT and data roaming), traffic breakdown and geographical/temporal distribution, communication performance (e.g., tunnel setup time, RTTs). Our results constitute a step towards advancing the understanding of IPX-Ps at their core, and provide guidelines for their operations and customer satisfaction.",

Recently, however, QR codes have been reported suffering attacks for being sniffed just before the QR code is scanned, which lead to financial loss. In this study, we propose ScreenID, for enhancing the QR code security by identifying its authenticity, which embeds a QR code with information of unique screen fingerprint - PWM frequency. PWM frequencies are adjusted to different values by screen manufacturers, therefore can successfully differentiate screens. To improve the estimation accuracy of PWM frequency, ScreenID incorporates a model for the interaction between the camera and screen in the temporal and spatial domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ScreenID can differentiate screens of different models, types and manufacturers and thus improve the security of QR codes.",

It captures fine-grained cardiovascular events such as the opening and closing of heart valves and the contraction and relaxation of heart chambers. Today, SCG recordings are obtained by strapping an accelerometer at the apex of the heart to measure chest wall vibrations. These recordings can be used to diagnose and monitor various cardiovascular conditions including myocardial infarction (heart attack), coronary heart disease, and ischemia.This paper introduces RF-SCG, a system that can capture SCG recordings without requiring any contact with the human body. The system operates by analyzing the reflections of millimeter-wave radar signals off the human body. RF-SCG can reconstruct the SCG waveform, and it can time 5 cardiovascular events within individual heartbeats with high accuracy. Our design is based on a hybrid architecture that combines signal processing with deep learning. The pipeline includes a 4D Cardiac Beamformer that can focus on the reflections of the human heart and a deep learning pipeline (RF-to-SCG Translator) that can transform these reflections into SCG waveforms. Empirical evaluation with 40,000 heartbeats from 21 healthy subjects demonstrates RF-SCG's ability to robustly time five key cardiovascular events (aortic valve opening, aortic valve closing, mitral valve opening, mitral valve closing, and isovolumetric contraction) with a median error between 0.26%-1.29%.",

                    "abstract": "Multiple vendors have recently released SmartNICs that provide both special-purpose accelerators and programmable processing cores that allow increasingly sophisticated packet processing tasks to be offloaded from general-purpose CPUs. Indeed, leading data-center operators have designed and deployed SmartNICs at scale to support both network virtualization and application-specific tasks. Unfortunately, cloud providers have not yet opened up the full power of these devices to tenants, as current runtimes do not provide adequate isolation between individual applications running on the SmartNICs themselves.We introduce FairNIC, a system to provide performance isolation between tenants utilizing the full capabilities of a commodity SoC SmartNIC. We implement FairNIC on Cavium LiquidIO 2360s and show that we are able to isolate not only typical packet processing, but also prevent MIPS-core cache pollution and fairly share access to fixed-function hardware accelerators. We use FairNIC to implement NIC-accelerated OVS and key/value store applications and show that they both can cohabitate on a single NIC using the same port, where the performance of each is unimpacted by other tenants. We argue that our results demonstrate the feasibility of sharing SmartNICs among virtual tenants, and motivate the development of appropriate security isolation mechanisms.",

Most of the current IoT system are specific and non-programmable and therefore their slices are difficult to reuse. It is difficult to meet different QoS requirements especially in IoT system because there are plenty of IoT sensors in IoT system. In this paper, we propose a novel IoT network slicing creation system which based on two emerging SDN and NFV technologies. It provides an easily-operating service creation environment and a service execution environment based on micro service architecture. We implement an IoT muti-flow transmission scenario. After adding subservices and QoS policies into a business process at the design plane, the IoT scenario can run automatically at the execution plane. Experiment results on the scenario show that the numbers of packets per second of different flows are changing gradually depend on QoS policies.",

Applications of these techniques are in indoor localization, gesture recognition, inventory tracking, vehicular motion, and many others. This paper identifies room for improvement over today's motion tracking techniques. The core observation is that conventional systems have trusted gravity more than the magnetic North to infer the 3D orientation of the object. We find that the reverse is more effective, especially when the object is in continuous fast motion. We leverage this opportunity to design MUSE, a magnetometer-centric sensor fusion algorithm for orientation tracking. Moreover, when the object's motion is somewhat restricted (e.g., human-arm motion restricted by elbow and shoulder joints), we find new methods of sensor fusion to fully leverage the restrictions. Real experiments across a wide range of uncontrolled scenarios show consistent improvement in orientation and location accuracy, without requiring any training or machine learning. We believe this is an important progress in the otherwise mature field of IMU-based motion tracking.",

                    "abstract": "In this paper, we are interested in the problem of counting a crowd of stationary people (i.e., seated) using a pair of WiFi transceivers. While the people in the crowd are stationary, i.e. with no major body motion except breathing, people do not stay still for a long period of time and frequently engage in small in-place body motions called fidgets (e.g., adjusting their seating position, crossing their legs, checking their phones, etc). In this paper, we propose that the aggregate natural fidgeting and in-place motions of a stationary crowd carry crucial information on the crowd count. We then mathematically characterize the Probability Distribution Function (PDF) of the crowd fidgeting and silent periods (which we can extract from the received WiFi signal) and show their dependency on the total number of people in the area. In developing our mathematical models, we show how our problem of interest resembles a several-decade-old M/G/\u221e queuing theory problem, which allows us to borrow mathematical tools from the literature on M/G/\u221e queues. We extensively validate our proposed approach with a total of 47 experiments in four different environments (including through-wall settings), in which up to and including N = 10 people are seated. We further test our system in different scenarios, and with different activities, representing various engagement levels of the crowd, such as attending a lecture, watching a movie, and reading. Moreover, we test our proposed system with different number of people seated in several different configurations. Our evaluation results show that our proposed approach achieves a very high counting accuracy, with the estimated number of people being only 0 or 1 off from the true number 96.3% of the time in non-through-wall settings, and 90% of the time in through-wall settings. Our results show the potential of our proposed framework for crowd counting in real-world scenarios.",

Road conditions in developing countries like India are chaotic where roads are not well maintained and thus vehicular sensors alone do not suffice in detecting impending collisions. In this paper, we investigate a collaborative driver assistance system \"DRIZY: DRIve eaSY\" for such scenarios where inference is drawn from on-board camera feed to alert drivers of obstacles ahead and the cloud uses GPS sensor data uploaded by all vehicles to alert drivers of vehicles in potential collision trajectory. Thus, we combine computer vision and vehicle-to-cloud communication to create comprehensive situational awareness. We prototype our system to consider two types of collisions: vehicle-to-vehicle collisions based on uploading GPS sensor data of vehicles to cloud and vehicle-to-pedestrian collisions based on detecting pedestrians from vehicle's dashboard camera feed. Sensor data processing in each vehicle occurs on smartphone for GPS values which are then uploaded to cloud and on raspberry pi3 for video feeds to make a cost-effective solution. Experiments over both 4G and wireless networks in India show that collaborative driver assistance is feasible in low traffic density within acceptable driver reaction time of &lt;5 sec, but can be limited by the time to process compute-intensive video feeds in real-time. We investigate novel ways to optimize the processing to find an acceptable trade-off.",

After the first remote control vehicle was born, the remote control unit was paired with a single vehicle for safety and security. To overcome this constrained remote control design, we propose a concept that a single manufacturing stand-alone RC can control one or several unmanned vehicles (UVs), regardless of vehicle type, named RC Function Virtualization (RFV). We can abstract the RC input to a high-level set of control commands and apply it to the numerous types of UVs connected through a wireless network. Our contribution is the separation of the RC and UV pairs so that the user can control all types of UVs even mixed types of UVs. We implemented the prototype of the RFV system, and demonstrated with Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV), Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV), and the combinations of them, with only one RC.",

This incurs a high deployment, maintenance and usage overhead. In this demo, we present RainbowLight, a low cost ambient light 3D localization approach easy to deploy in today's buildings. Our key finding is that light through a chip of polarizer and birefringence material produces specific interference and light spectrum at different directions to the chip. We derive a model to characterize the relation for direction, light interference and spectrum. Exploiting the model, RainbowLight calculates the direction to a chip after taking a photo containing the chip. With multiple chips, RainbowLight designs a direction intersection based method to derive the location. This demo shows our prototype of implementation, with simple photo capturing and deriving location of camera on mobile phone. The evaluation results show that RainbowLight achieves an average localization error of 3.3 cm in 2D and 9.6 cm in 3D for light on, and an error of 7.4 cm in 2D and 20.5 cm in 3D for light off scenario in daytime.",

Existing electric toothbrushing monitoring systems fail to detect these issues because they cannot achieve fine-grained position tracking. In this paper, we present a novel electric toothbrushing monitoring system called MET that tracks brushing coverage for all the 15 surfaces of teeth and detects different types of incorrect brushing techniques. This design is inspired by our observation that the motor inside an electric toothbrush generates a unique magnetic field, which can serve as a reliable signal for position and orientation tracking. MET is the first system that tracks both the position and orientation of an unmodified electric motor using magnetic inductive sensing. Experiments with fourteen users show that the average toothbrushing surface recognition accuracy of MET is 85.3%. Moreover, MET is robust to user location changes and posture variations and does not require any training from the users. Experimental results also demonstrate our significant advantages over existing commercial systems.",

                    "abstract": "A legal contract is an agreement between two or more parties as to something that is to be done in the future. Forming contracts electronically is desirable since it is convenient. However, existing electronic contract platforms have a critical shortcoming. They do not provide strong evidence that a contract has been legally and validly created. More specifically, they do not provide strong evidence that an electronic signature is authentic, that there was mutual assent, and that the parties had an opportunity to read the contract. We present Tabellion, a system for forming legal contracts on mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, that addresses the above shortcoming. We define four secure primitives and use them in Tabellion to introduce self-evident contracts, the validity of which can be verified by independent inspectors. We show how these primitives can be implemented securely in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) of mobile devices as well as a secure enclave in a centralized server, all with a small Trusted Computing Base (TCB). Moreover, we demonstrate that it is feasible to build a fully functional contract platform on top of these primitives. We develop ~15,000 lines of code (LoC) for our prototype, only ~1,000 of which need to be trusted. Through analysis, prototype measurements, and a 30-person user study, we show that Tabellion is secure, achieves acceptable performance, and provides slightly better usability than the state-of-the-art electronic contract platform, DocuSign, for viewing and signing contracts.",

The research direction for those mobility networks should be treated differently. We propose a CNN-based noble framework for friendship prediction, which starts from collecting location data to a classification model to learn their relation between friendships and mobility. From the experiment, we show that our system outperforms empirical supervised learning techniques and also can be useful for friendship prediction of the future.",

                    "abstract": "This paper presents a fully distributed scheduling framework called CASTLE (Client-side Adaptive Scheduler That minimizes Load and Energy), which jointly optimizes the spectral efficiency of cellular networks and battery consumption of smart devices. To do so, we focus on scenarios when many smart devices compete for cellular resources in the same base station: spreading out transmissions over time so that only a few devices transmit at once improves both spectral efficiency and battery consumption. To this end, we devise two novel features in CASTLE. First, we explicitly consider inter-cell interference for accurate cellular load estimation. Based on our observations, we exploit the RSRQ (Reference Signal Received Quality) and SINR as features in a machine learning algorithm to accurately estimate the cellular load. Second, we propose a fully distributed scheduling algorithm that coordinates transmissions between clients based on the locally estimated load level at each client. Our formulation for minimizing battery consumption at each device leads to an optimized backoff-based algorithm that fits practical environments. To evaluate these features, we prototype a complete LTE system testbed consisting of mobile devices, eNodeBs, EPC (Evolved Packet Core) and application servers. Our comprehensive experimental results show that CASTLE's load estimation is up to 91% accurate, and that CASTLE achieves higher spectral efficiency with less battery consumption, compared to existing centralized scheduling algorithms as well as a distributed CSMA-like protocol. Furthermore, we develop a light-weight SDK that can expedite the deployment of CASTLE into smart devices and evaluate it in a commercial LTE network.",

The fundamental difficulty to quickly mitigate NPAs lies in the limitations of state-of-the-art network monitoring solutions --- coarse-grained counters, active probing, or packet telemetry either cannot provide enough insights on flows or incur too much overhead. This paper presents NetSeer, a flow event telemetry (FET) monitor which aims to discover and record all performance-critical data plane events, e.g. packet drops, congestion, path change, and packet pause. NetSeer is efficiently realized on the programmable data plane. It has a high coverage on flow events including inter-switch packet drop/corruption which is critical but also challenging to retrieve the original flow information, with novel intra- and inter-switch event detection algorithms running on data plane; NetSeer also achieves high scalability and accuracy with innovative designs of event aggregation, information compression, and message batching that mainly run on data plane, using switch CPU as complement. NetSeer has been implemented on commodity programmable switches and NICs. With real case studies and extensive experiments, we show NetSeer can reduce NPA mitigation time by 61%-99% with only 0.01% overhead of monitoring traffic.",

                    "abstract": "60 GHz millimeter-wave networking has emerged as the next frontier technology to provide multi-Gbps wireless connectivity. However, the intrinsic directionality and limited field-of-view of 60 GHz antennas make the links extremely sensitive to user mobility and orientation change. Hence, seamless coverage, even at room level, becomes challenging. In this paper, we propose Pia, a robust 60 GHz network architecture that can provide seamless coverage and mobility support at multi-Gbps bitrate. Pia comprises multiple cooperating access points (APs). It leverages the pose information on mobile clients to proactively select the AP and manage multi-link spatial reuse. These decisions require a model of the pose/location of the APs and ambient reflectors. We address these challenges through a set of AP-pose sensing and compressive angle estimation algorithms that fuse the pose measurement with link quality measurement on the client. We have implemented Pia using commodity 60 GHz platforms. Our experiments show that Pia reduces the occurrence of link outage by 6.3x and improves the spatial sharing capacity by 76%, compared to conventional schemes that only use in-band information for adaptation.",

In this paper, we demonstrate the ability to use multipath reflections to enhance localization rather than throwing them away. We present Multipath Triangulation, a new localization technique that uses multipath reflections to localize a target device with a single receiver that does not require any form of coordination with any other devices. In this paper, we leverage multipath triangulation to build the first decimeter-level WiFi localization system, called MonoLoco, that requires only a single access point (AP) and a single channel, and does not impose any overhead, data sharing, or coordination protocols beyond standard WiFi communication. As a bonus, it also determines the orientation of the target relative to the AP. We implemented MonoLoco using Intel 5300 commodity WiFi cards and deploy it in four environments with different multipath propagation. Results indicate median localization error of 0.5m and median orientation error of 6.6 degrees, which are comparable to the best performing prior systems, all of which require multiple APs and/or multiple frequency channels. High accuracy can be achieved with only a handful of packets.",

Each integrated FD radio consists of an antenna, a customized Gen-2 RF self-interference (SI) canceller box, a USRP software-defined radio, and a remotely accessible compute node. The RF SI canceller box includes an RF canceller printed circuit board which emulates an integrated circuit implementation based on the technique of frequency-domain equalization. The Gen-2 canceller box can achieve up to 50 dB RF SI cancellation across 20MHz bandwidth. In this demo, we present the design and implementation of the open-acccess, remotely accessible FD radios that are integrated in the indoor COSMOS Sandbox 2 at Columbia University. We also demonstrate example experiments that are available to researchers, where demo participants can observe the visualized performance of the open-access FD radios.",

The goal of this work is to investigate a trustworthy, continuous, and non-contact user authentication approach based on a heart-related biometric that works in a daily-life environment. To this end, we present a novel, continuous authentication system, namely Cardiac Scan, based on geometric and non-volitional features of the cardiac motion. Cardiac motion is an automatic heart deformation caused by self-excitement of the cardiac muscle, which is unique to each user and is difficult (if not impossible) to counterfeit. Cardiac Scan features intrinsic liveness detection, unobtrusiveness, cost-effectiveness, and high usability. We prototype a remote, high-resolution cardiac motion sensing system based on the smart DC-coupled continuous-wave radar. Fiducial-based invariant identity descriptors of cardiac motion are extracted after the radar signal demodulation. We conduct a pilot study with 78 subjects to evaluate Cardiac Scan in accuracy, authentication time, permanence, evaluation in complex conditions, and vulnerability. Specifically, Cardiac Scan achieves 98.61% balanced accuracy (BAC) and 4.42% equal error rate (EER) in a real-world setup. We demonstrate that Cardiac Scan is a robust and usable continuous authentication system.",

Through a MIMO array of phased arrays with hundreds of antenna elements, mmWave can boost wireless bit-rates to 100+ Gbps, and potentially achieve near-vision sensing resolution. However, the lack of an experimental platform has been impeding research in this field. This paper fills the gap with M3 (M-Cube), the first mmWave massive MIMO software radio. M3 features a fully reconfigurable array of phased arrays, with up to 8 RF chains and 288 antenna elements. Despite the orders of magnitude larger antenna arrays, its cost is orders of magnitude lower, even when compared with state-of-the-art single RF chain mmWave software radios. The key design principle behind M3 is to hijack a low-cost commodity 802.11ad radio, separate the control path and data path inside, regenerate the phased array control signals, and recreate the data signals using a programmable baseband. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the M3 design, and its usefulness for research in mmWave massive MIMO communication and sensing.",

Their recognition performance is poor for flat and monotone walls. This drawback is significant because most walls in indoor environments are flat and only a small portion of them are colorful enough to detect feature points.",

In this work, we show that broad classes of popular mobile applications have distinct radio resource allocation signatures. Using this insight, we design a mobile application classifier, and demonstrate that (1) an application can infer its own type solely from its resource allocation patterns, and (2) anyone can accurately infer the type of application being served by each session on a particular cell tower. We present our findings by showing the breakdown of applications being served by an LTE base station belonging to a Tier 1 US provider in downtown Palo Alto. Our work encourages an open discussion about LTE standards, and whether they might need to be enhanced to mask features that can be exploited to infer application type from signals broadcast over the air.",

To address this issue, we propose TKL-WinSMS as a systematic strategy, which is able to realize robust and adaptive localization in dynamic indoor environments. We developed a WiFi-based Non-intrusive Sensing and Monitoring System (WinSMS) that enables COTS WiFi routers as online reference points by extracting real-time RSS readings among them. With these online data and labeled source data from the offline calibrated radio map, we further combine the RSS readings from target mobile devices as unlabeled target data, to design a robust localization model using an emerging transfer learning algorithm, namely transfer kernel learning (TKL). It can learn a domain-invariant kernel by directly matching the source and target distributions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space instead of the raw noisy signal space. By leveraging the resultant kernel as input for the SVR training, the trained localization model can inherit the information from online phase to adaptively enhance the offline calibrated radio map. Extensive experimental results verify the superiority of TKL-WinSMS in terms of localization accuracy compared with existing solutions in dynamic indoor environments.",

This is true for testbeds, where few, if any, can afford a dedicated, full-scale replica of a data center. It is also true for simulations, which while originally designed for precisely this purpose, have struggled to cope with the size of today's networks. This paper presents an approach for quickly obtaining accurate performance estimates for large data center networks. Our system,MimicNet, provides users with the familiar abstraction of a packet-level simulation for a portion of the network while leveraging redundancy and recent advances in machine learning to quickly and accurately approximate portions of the network that are not directly visible. MimicNet can provide over two orders of magnitude speedup compared to regular simulation for a data center with thousands of servers. Even at this scale, MimicNet estimates of the tail FCT, throughput, and RTT are within 5% of the true results.",

However, DA capabilities have been subverted and abused: malicious apps have used DA to create ransomware or lock users out, while benign apps have used DA to prevent or hinder uninstallation; in certain cases the only remedy is to factory-reset the phone. We call these apps \"Deathless Device Administrator\" (DDA), i.e., apps that cannot be uninstalled. We provide the first systematic study of Android DA capabilities, DDA apps, DDA-attack resistance across Android versions, and DDA-induced families in malicious apps. To enable scalable studies of questionable DA behavior, we developed DAAX, a static analyzer which exposes potential DA abuse effectively and efficiently. In a corpus of 39,459 apps (20,467 malicious and 18,992 benign) DAAX has found 4,135 DA apps and 691 potential DDA apps. The static analysis results on the 4,135 apps were cross-checked via dynamic analysis on at least 3 phones, confirming 578 true DDAs, including apps currently on Google Play.

Shoofly leverages optical signal quality and traffic demand telemetry from a large commercial cloud provider to identify optical bypasses in the cloud WAN that reduce the hardware cost of long-haul capacity by 40%. A key challenge is that optical bypasses cause signals to travel longer distances on fiber before re-generation, potentially reducing link capacities and resilience to optical link failures. Despite these challenges, Shoofly provisions bypass-enabled topologies that meet 8X the present-day demands using existing network hardware. Even under aggressive stochastic and deterministic link failure scenarios, these topologies save 32% of the cost of long-haul capacity.",

                    "abstract": "With recent advances in in-band full duplex techniques, full duplex capable relays have been shown feasible in many recent works. Instead of generating data itself to transmit, a full duplex relay can forward the received signal while receiving it. It also has the opportunity to properly modify the signal before forwarding it, which has been explored to enable constructive and destructive full duplex relaying recently. With these designs, the signal through the full duplex relay could constructively or destructively add up with the signal from the direct link at the receiver side. As a result, the received signal power may be boosted or greatly reduced, compared with direct forwarding. In this paper, we do detailed analysis on whether such constructive and destructive full duplex relays are possible. We find that for OFDM signals, such relays can not be achieved if the additional latency of the relayed path is more than one sample time than the direct link. Our analysis and results challenge the assumptions on the relay latency requirements of previous works to realize such systems.",

However, existing VLP systems either require specialized LEDs which hinder large-scale deployment, or need cameras which preclude continuous localization because of high power consumption and short coverage. In this paper, we propose Pulsar, which uses a compact photodiode sensor, readily fit into a mobile device, to discriminate existing ceiling lights---either fluorescent lights or conventional LEDs---based on their intrinsic optical emission features. To overcome the photodiode's lack of spatial resolution, we design a novel sparse photogrammetry mechanism, which resolves the light source's angle-of-arrival, and triangulates the device's 3D location and even orientation. To facilitate ubiquitous deployment, we further develop a light registration mechanism that automatically registers the ceiling lights' locations as landmarks on a building's floor map. Our experiments demonstrate that Pulsar can reliably achieve decimeter precision in both controlled environment and large-scale buildings.",

                    "abstract": "With exponential growth of IoT devices [1], the 5G network will experience a variety of traffic patterns not prevalent in earlier applications. These, often will transmit short sporadic messages, which are not well suited to the connection-oriented modes associated with legacy 3GPP network resulting in high service latency and excessive control overhead. It is acknowledged that current 4G network could be overwhelmed by the surge in both traffic and control plane signaling load. For 5G, it is necessary to redesign the mobile network to provide a low delay, low control overhead IoT mode that will work efficiently for emerging application scenarios. The MAC layer has to be designed in such a way that IoT messages experience low access latency across both the radio access network and core network. The goal is to operate in the same band as current LTE, thus not requiring any separate bandwidth allocation and is backward compatible with the current 4G system. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer MAC and Physical layer solution for low power, low bitrate devices that require low access delay and long range for communication.",

However, in areas facing the ocean, the risks of secondary disasters due to tsunamis are extremely high. We conducted research the on an emergency disaster prevention system for transmitting tsunami information using ultra-low- frequency sound sensors and tide-level gauges. The system conveyed the information to members in the crisis management staff for the area concerned, and we assumed that the staff in charge made evacuation recommendations to the citizens of the area based on the information. In addition, when a tsunami occurs, there is a high possibility that an existing infrastructure cannot be used because an earthquake has already occurred. In this research, we develop a disaster prevention system using tsunami information using long-distance wireless communication technology, MAD-SS.",

However, in practice, mmWave performance scales poorly for large numbers of users due to the significant overhead required to manage the highly-directional beams. We find that we can substantially reduce or eliminate this overhead by using out-of-band infrared measurements of the surrounding environment generated by a LiDAR sensor. To accomplish this, we develop a ray-tracing system that is robust to noise and other artifacts from the infrared sensor, create a method to estimate the reflection strength from sensor data, and finally apply this information to the multiuser beam selection process. We demonstrate that this approach reduces beam-selection overhead by over 95% in indoor multi-user scenarios, reducing network latency by over 80% and increasing throughput by over 2\\texttimes{} in mobile scenarios.",

                    "abstract": "A long-standing challenge in radios for wearables is to design ultra-low power, yet high performance receivers with good sensitivity and spectral efficiency while being compatible with WiFi. The vanilla envelope detector used in standard UHF RFID is the most popular receivers on backscatter tags since they are passive but suffer from poor sensitivity and cannot decode complex modulations, which makes them a poor choice for directly decoding data from WiFi packets.In this paper, we present the design of an easy-to-prototype ultra-low power WiFi receiver called MIXIQ that operates at \u03bcWs of power while providing improved sensitivity and decode-ability of complex high-rate signals. MIXIQ uses the signaling capabilities of the newest standard of WiFi, 802.11ax, to turn a standard WiFi packet into a helper + data signal. The same non-linear RF circuit used in a vanilla envelope detector, when driven by this twin signal, now behaves like a passive mixer i.e. it down-converts the RF carrier data to the sub-MHz range without adding any energy overhead. MIXIQ then uses an ultra low-power largely digital baseband pipeline to (i) significantly boost sensitivity using ultra low power components; (ii) enable the demodulation of complex signals for substantial boost in spectral efficiency. We show that MIXIQ improves upon the vanilla envelope detector by 25dB in sensitivity and 89\\texttimes{} in bandwidth efficiency, while consuming 0.3mW for a PCB-based implementation and 40\u03bcW for CMOS simulation. We also demonstrate a Hearable system that leverages MIXIQ to improve VOIP reception range by 10\\texttimes{} compared to a vanilla envelope detector.",

However, 3D sensors from a single vehicle suffer from two fundamental limitations: vulnerability to occlusion and loss of details on far-away objects. To overcome both limitations, in this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate EMP, a novel edge-assisted multi-vehicle perception system for CAVs. In EMP, multiple nearby CAVs share their raw sensor data with an edge server which then merges CAVs' individual views to form a more complete view with a higher resolution. The merged view can drastically enhance the perception quality of the participating CAVs. Our core methodological contribution is to make the sensor data sharing scalable, adaptive, and resource-efficient over oftentimes highly fluctuating wireless links through a series of novel algorithms, which are then integrated into a full-fledged cooperative sensing pipeline. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that EMP can achieve real-time processing at 24 FPS and end-to-end latency of 93 ms on average. EMP reduces the end-to-end latency by 49% to 65% compared to the traditional vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) sharing approach without edge support. Our case studies show that cooperative sensing powered by EMP can detect hazards such as blind spots faster by 0.5 to 1.1 seconds, compared to a single vehicle's perception.",

For example, route planning, gas price applications, and Siri-like personal assistants all respond to user queries based in part on cloud processing. Network communication thus is often a substantial component of user-perceived latency in vehicular applications. Current vehicular computing platforms typically connect to the cloud using a single cellular network provider. Network conditions can change rapidly as a vehicle moves due to geographical variation in coverage, radio shadows, and differing traffic density. Such variation is often exacerbated by connection re-establishment after an interface has entered a sleep state. Thus, vehicular applications can often appear unresponsive due to high wireless network latency. Even worse, the responsiveness is unpredictable; high tail latency makes some user interactions take longer, even when most interactions complete in an acceptable amount of time. This unpredictability is especially worrisome in a vehicular environment, in which occasional unexpected performance anomalies distract the driver of the vehicle.",

However, existing visible light localization systems require customized light hardware, which increases deployment cost and hinders near term adoption. In this paper, we propose LiTell, a simple and robust localization scheme that employs unmodified fluorescent lights (FLs) as location landmarks and commodity smartphones as light sensors. LiTell builds on the key observation that each FL has an inherent characteristic frequency which can serve as a discriminative feature. It incorporates a set of sampling, signal amplification and camera optimization mechanisms, that enable a smartphone to capture the extremely weak and high frequency ( &gt; 80 kHz) features. We have implemented LiTell as a real-time localization and navigation system on Android. Our experiments demonstrate LiTell's high reliability in discriminating different FLs, and its potential to achieve sub-meter location granularity. Our user study in a multi-storey office building, parking lot and grocery store further validates LiTell as an accurate, robust and ready-to-use indoor localization system.",

In this paper, we propose LLAP, a device-free gesture tracking scheme that can be deployed on existing mobile devices as software, without any hardware modification. We use speakers and microphones that already exist on most mobile devices to perform device-free tracking of a hand/finger. The key idea is to use acoustic phase to get fine-grained movement direction and movement distance measurements. LLAP first extracts the sound signal reflected by the moving hand/finger after removing the background sound signals that are relatively consistent over time. LLAP then measures the phase changes of the sound signals caused by hand/finger movements and then converts the phase changes into the distance of the movement. We implemented and evaluated LLAP using commercial-off-the-shelf mobile phones. For 1-D hand movement and 2-D drawing in the air, LLAP has a tracking accuracy of 3.5 mm and 4.6 mm, respectively. Using gesture traces tracked by LLAP, we can recognize the characters and short words drawn in the air with an accuracy of 92.3% and 91.2%, respectively.",

TYTH allows its user to interact with a computing system by tapping on their teeth. This form of interaction is analogous to using a finger to type on a keypad except that the tongue substitutes for the finger and the teeth for the keyboard. We study the neurological and anatomical structures of the tongue to design TYTH so that the obtrusiveness and social awkwardness caused by the wearable is minimized while maximizing its accuracy and sensing sensitivity. From behind the user's ears, TYTH senses the brain signals and muscle signals that control tongue movement sent from the brain and captures the miniature skin surface deformation caused by tongue movement. We model the relationship between tongue movement and the signals recorded, from which a tongue localization technique and tongue-teeth tapping detection technique are derived. Through a prototyping implementation and an evaluation with 15 subjects, we show that TYTH can be used as a form of hands-free human computer interaction with 88.61% detection rate and promising adoption rate by users.",

The sensors measure heterogeneous time-varying signals and report their measurements to the central monitoring station which uses them to make control decisions. Due to limited communication capacity, not all sensors can send updates to the monitoring station at all times. The cost of the system pays at any time is a weighted sum of the ages-of-information of the various sensors at that time. The goal is to design scheduling policies which minimize the time-average of this cost. We propose a policy called SQRT-Weight which schedules updates from sensors at a frequency proportional to the square-root of the corresponding weights and show that this policy is asymptotically 8--optimal. In addition, we compare the performance of the SQRT-Weight policy with other natural scheduling policies via simulations.",

Given high computational demands, general visual processing must currently be offloaded to the cloud. To reduce mobile battery and bandwidth consumption, recent proposals offload only \"interesting\" video frames, discarding the rest. However, determining what to discard is itself typically a power-hungry computer vision calculation, very often well beyond what most mobile devices can afford on a continuous basis. We present the Glimpse system, a re-design of the conventional mobile video processing pipeline to support such \"early discard\" flexibly, efficiently and accurately. Glimpse is a novel architecture that gates wearable vision using low-power vision modalities. Our proposed architecture adds novel sensing, processing, algorithmic and programming-system components to the camera pipeline to this end. We present a complete implementation and evaluation of our design. In common settings, Glimpse reduces mobile power and data usage by more than one order of magnitude relative to earlier designs, and moves continuous vision on lightweight wearables to the realm of the practical.",

To tap-in the gold-mine of data generated by IoT devices with unprecedented volume and value, we discover and leverage the hidden connections among the multimodal data collected by various sensing devices. Different modal data can complete and learn from each other, but it is challenging to fuse multimodal data without knowing their perception (and thus the correct labels). In this work, we propose MultiSense, a paradigm for automatically mining potential perception, cross-labelling each modal data, and then improving the learning models over the set of multimodal data. We design innovative solutions for segmenting, aligning, and fusing multimodal data from different sensors. We implement our framework and conduct comprehensive evaluations on a rich set of data. Our results demonstrate that MultiSense significantly improves the data usability and the power of the learning models.",

                    "abstract": "Mobile devices today provide a hardware-protected mode called Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to help protect users from a compromised OS and hypervisor. Today TEE can only be leveraged either by vendor apps or by developers who work with the vendor. Since vendors consider third-party app code untrusted inside the TEE, to allow an app to leverage TEE, app developers have to write the app code in a tailored way to work with the vendor's SDK. We proposed a novel design to integrate TEE with mobile OS to allow any app to leverage the TEE. Our design incorporates TEE support at the OS level, allowing apps to leverage the TEE without adding app-specific code into the TEE, and while using existing interface to interact with the mobile OS. We implemented our design, called TruZ-Droid, by integrating TrustZone TEE with the Android OS. TruZ-Droid allows apps to leverage the TEE to protect the following: (i) user's secret input and confirmation, and (ii) sending of user's secrets to the authorized server. We built a prototype using the TrustZone-enabled HiKey board to evaluate our design. We demonstrated TruZ-Droid's effectiveness by adding new security features to existing apps to protect user's sensitive information and attest user's confirmation. TruZ-Droid's real-world use case evaluation shows that apps can leverage TrustZone while using existing OS APIs. Our usability study proves that users can correctly interact with TruZ-Droid to protect their security sensitive activities and data.",

                    "abstract": "The cloud gateway is essential in the public cloud as the central hub of cloud traffic. We show that horizontal scaling of software gateways, once sustainable for years, is no longer future-proof facing the massive scale and rapid growth of today's cloud. The root cause is the stagnant performance of the CPU core, which is prone to be overloaded by heavy hitters as traffic growth goes far beyond Moore's law. To address this, we propose emph{Sailfish}, a cloud-scale multi-tenant multi-service gateway accelerated by programmable switches. The new challenge is that large forwarding tables due to multi-tenancy cannot be fit into the limited on-chip memories. To this end, we devise a multi-pronged approach with (1) hardware/software co-design for table sharing, (2) horizontal table splitting among gateway clusters, (3) pipeline-aware table compression for a single node. Compared with the x86 gateway of a similar price, Sailfish reduces latency by 95% (2\u03bcs), improves throughput by more than 20x in bps (3.2Tbps) and 71x in pps (1.8Gpps) with packet length &lt; 256B. Sailfish has been deployed in Alibaba Cloud for more than two years. It is the first P4-based cloud gateway in the industry, of which a single cluster carries dozens of Tbps traffic, withstanding peak-hour traffic in large online shopping festivals.",

To address the unique issues in underwater environment such as water flow and scattered sunlight interference, we exploit the circularly polarized light (CPL) and double links for underwater VLC transmission. A coding scheme tailored for underwater communication based on double CPL design is developed. We prototype Shrimp on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) LEDs with fabricated printed circuit boards (PCBs). Extensive experiments conducted in an indoor water pool, a lake, and the sea demonstrate that Shrimp can combat against environmental interference and achieve robust communication in underwater environments. The communication distance can be up to 3 m in sea/lake water using a 3 W commodity LED, outperforming the VLC schemes designed for in-air communication.",

However, filtering has typically been done with neural networks running on edge/backend servers that are expensive to operate. This paper investigates on-camera filtering, which moves filtering to the beginning of the pipeline. Unfortunately, we find that commodity cameras have limited compute resources that only permit filtering via frame differencing based on low-level video features. Used incorrectly, such techniques can lead to unacceptable drops in query accuracy. To overcome this, we built Reducto, a system that dynamically adapts filtering decisions according to the time-varying correlation between feature type, filtering threshold, query accuracy, and video content. Experiments with a variety of videos and queries show that Reducto achieves significant (51-97% of frames) filtering benefits, while consistently meeting the desired accuracy.",

However, there are severely challenges to using video codec on mobile devices, because: 1) insufficient computing resources, there is poor performance using mobile device\u202f; 2) the limited battery capacity on mobile device; 3) CPU utilization is too high when using traditional video codec. In this paper, we proposed a GPU based High Definition Parallel Video Codec on mobile devices, which is an efficient video codec with the cooperation of CPU and GPU. The video codec system is fully compliant with the video codec h264 standard. Compared with the scheme using existing X264, the presented experimental results evaluated the GPU based video codec achieves appreciable improvements in FPS(frames per second), the energy consumption and utilization of CPU are reduced properly at the same time.",

BARNET not only provides identification of tagged objects but also can serve as a 'device-free' activity recognition system. BARNET's key innovation is the concept of backscatter channel state information (BCSI) which can be measured via systematic multiphase probing of the backscatter tag-to-tag channel using innovative processing on the passive tags. So far such measurements were only possible using active radio receivers that consume much higher power. Changes in BCSI provide signatures for different activities in the environment that can be learned using suitable machine learning tools. We develop the BARNET tag architecture which shows that an ASIC implementation can run on harvested RF power. We develop a printed circuit board (PCB) prototype using discrete components to evaluate activity recognition performance. We show that the prototype can recognize human daily activities with an average error around 6%. Overall, BARNET uses passive tags to achieve the same level of performance as systems that use powered, active radios.",

Working with a major cellular network operator on a part of their RAN that services more than 2 million users, we demonstrate that fine-grained modeling and analysis could be the key towards this goal. We describe our methodology in analyzing RAN problems, and highlight a few of our findings, some previously unknown. We also discuss lessons from our attempt at building automated diagnosis solutions.",

                    "abstract": "In 5G, the requirement of transmission latency is stricter than that in 4G. To enhance transmission efficiency, a user plane function (UPF) with a specific packet processing mechanism is necessary. However, UPF must communicate with the session management function (SMF), which will send the packet processing rules to UPF. Those rules will substantially occupy UPF storage. Moreover, customizing a UPF needs to reconstruct N3, N4, N6, and N9 interfaces, which takes much time for developers. To this end, we propose the user plane function development framework (UPFDF), which modularizes the functions in the UPF, supporting customization to connect different types of packet processing mechanisms. With UPFDF, we address the UPF capacity problem and improve the flexibility of the system.",

Concatenating virtual network functions (VNFs) into service function chains (SFCs) provides flexible and diverse network support for intelligent applications. However, the mobile network connection is very unreliable. A reasonable SFC composition mechanism is essential for stable service providing. This paper proposes a high availability service function chain composition approach, TSFCC. TSFCC includes real-time road marking strategy, bi-composition mechanism, and VNF reallocation mechanism. Evaluation results prove that TSFCC can adapt to the mobile network environment and provide users with efficient and highly available SFC service.",

Apple first introduced AWDL around 2014 and has since integrated it into its entire product line, including iPhone and Mac. While we have found that AWDL drives popular applications such as AirPlay and AirDrop on more than one billion end-user devices, neither the protocol itself nor potential security and Wi-Fi coexistence issues have been studied. In this paper, we present the operation of the protocol as the result of binary and runtime analysis. In short, each AWDL node announces a sequence of Availability Windows (AWs) indicating its readiness to communicate with other AWDL nodes. An elected master node synchronizes these sequences. Outside the AWs, nodes can tune their Wi-Fi radio to a different channel to communicate with an access point, or could turn it off to save energy. Based on our analysis, we conduct experiments to study the master election process, synchronization accuracy, channel hopping dynamics, and achievable throughput. We conduct a preliminary security assessment and publish an open source Wireshark dissector for AWDL to nourish future work.",

                    "abstract": "Video streaming service has been essential to the Internet ecosystem since a majority of Internet contents is consumed via streaming ser-vices, such as Netflix and Youtube [3]. Moreover, contents providers started to upload 4K and even 8K videos on streaming service to satisfy users' demand for higher quality of streaming service in accordance with the recent refinement on display technology.However, the available bandwidth in most of the developed countries can barely support single full HD contents streaming service [1]. Such bandwidth shortage intensifies in 360 video streaming service even at a larger scale, as 360 video contents providers started to upload 4K or 8K videos at the higher frame rate(60FPS or 120FPS). No current ISP (Internet service provider) can sustain the bandwidth needed for such scale of video contents [1]. To overcome the aforementioned network limitations, many re-searchers and engineers suggested ingenious mechanisms to reduce contents size. One of the mechanisms is viewport-only streaming service that streams a partial region in each video frame that fits in the exact viewport in an HMD device (e.g., HTC Vive, OculusVR, Google Daydream VR, and Samsung GearVR) in real-time [6].Assuming the size of the viewport is set to 90 degree, the bandwidth required for the viewport-only streaming service can be approximately reduced by an eighth of the original 360 video. Although the viewport-only streaming service can reduce con-tents size significantly, it is infeasible yet due to the existing streaming network latency. Even with the state-of-the-art content delivery network (CDN), viewport-only streaming service cannot satisfy the 10ms latency requirement in the standard Internet as demonstrated in other interactive multimedia systems [4]. Consequently, viewers can suffer discontinuity of streaming contents even in the highly optimized streaming service [8]. Thus, the research trend moved to the viewport adaptive stream-ing service that buffers segments of contents where a viewport Such reduction of contents size is achieved by the contents compression process that provides the original resolution in the Field ofView(FoV) while compromising the video quality outside the FoV. Despite the reduction of contents size and delivery of navigable 360 video contents, viewport adaptive streaming service cannot accommodate viewers' head movement within buffered video frames,especially when a viewer's focal point deviates from the viewport within the buffered frames. In this case, viewers can experience video distortions or degradation of resolutions [8]. Therefore, anew encoding mechanism that can handle viewers' deviation from the viewport while reducing contents size is required for viewers'immersive experience.To answer the requirements, we propose a saliency-based view-port adaptive streaming service, SALI360 that focuses on improving viewers' quality of perception in 360 video contents. To achieve high perception quality, we first adopt visual saliency model [9]to predict fixation regions in 360 video contents. Then we render the fixation regions on top of the geometry based encoded regions.Specifically, SALI360 encodes the peripheral regions in lower resolution to reduce the contents size, and encodes the fixation regions in higher resolution to increase the quality of perception.",

Since there is no traffic jam in the subway, accuracy is one of the most crucial characters of the subway. However, subway trains are often delayed by some reasons like an accident. The delay can make many people confused and inconvenient. In this context, the need for dynamic timetable model which corrects the error of timetable in real time has emerged. Since the method to detect train moving is necessary to modify timetable, various solutions are proposed in the indoor positioning way, such as Wi-Fi fingerprint, magnetometer and so on. A method using Wi-Fi fingerprint is a primary way in indoor positioning, but it is tough to build a radio map for every single station. Shin et al. suggested a solution using a magnetometer, with simple judging criteria named 'decision peak.' This research proved that a magnetometer is a practical solution. Nonetheless, it can not detect the train moving in some cases. We propose a new method to detect the subway moving using a linear accelerometer, based on the essence of the problem.",

In this paper, we present SpiroSonic, a new system design that uses commodity smartphones to support complete, accurate yet reliable spirometry tests in regular home settings with various environmental and human factors. SpiroSonic measures the humans' chest wall motion via acoustic sensing and interprets such motion into lung function indices, based on the clinically validated correlation between them. We implemented SpiroSonic as a smartphone app, and verified SpiroSonic's monitoring error over healthy humans as &lt;3%. Clinical studies further show that SpiroSonic reaches 5%-10% monitoring error among 83 pediatric patients. Given that the error of in-clinic spirometry is usually around 5%, SpiroSonic can be reliably used for disease tracking and evaluation out of clinic.",

OpenMili builds from off-the-shelf FPGA processor, data converters and 60 GHz RF front-end. It employs customized clocking, channelization and interfacing modules, to achieve Gsps sampling bandwidth, Gbps wireless bit-rate, and Gsps sample streaming from/to a PC host. It also incorporates the first programmable, electronically steerable 60 GHz phased-array antenna. OpenMili adopts programming models that ease development, through automatic parallelization inside signal processing blocks, and modular, rate-insensitive interfaces across blocks. It provides common reference designs to bootstrap the development of new network protocols and sensing applications. We verify the effectiveness of OpenMili through benchmark communication/sensing experiments, and showcase its usage by prototyping a pairwise phased-array localization scheme, and a learning-assisted real-time beam adaptation protocol.",

To date, however, even the most effective CTC systems require these devices to operate in the same ISM band (e.g., 2.4 GHz) because of the conventional wisdom that wireless transceivers with different (fundamental) frequencies cannot communicate with one another. Our work, which is called TiFi, challenges this belief by allowing a 2.4 GHz WiFi receiver (e.g., a smartphone) to identify UHF RFID tags, which operates at the spectrum between 840 - 920 MHz. TiFi does not require changing current smartphones or tags. Instead, it leverages the underlying harmonic backscattering of tags to open a second channel and uses it to communicate with WiFi receivers. We design and implement TiFi with commodity WiFi chipsets (e.g., Broadcom BCM43xx, Murata KM6D280 40, and Qualcomm WCN3990). Our comprehensive evaluation shows that TiFi allows WiFi receivers to identify UHF RFID tags within the range of 2&nbsp;m and with a median goodput of 95%, which is comparable to today's mobile RFID readers.",

Using mechanical drones to move sensors, however, severely limits operation time since flight time is limited by the energy density of current battery technology. We explore an alternative, biology-based solution: integrate sensing, computing and communication functionalities onto live flying insects to create a mobile IoT platform. Such an approach takes advantage of these tiny, highly efficient biological insects which are ubiquitous in many outdoor ecosystems, to essentially provide mobility for free. Doing so however requires addressing key technical challenges of power, size, weight and self-localization in order for the insects to perform location-dependent sensing operations as they carry our IoT payload through the environment. We develop and deploy our platform on bumblebees which includes backscatter communication, low-power self-localization hardware, sensors, and a power source. We show that our platform is capable of sensing, backscattering data at 1 kbps when the insects are back at the hive, and localizing itself up to distances of 80 m from the access points, all within a total weight budget of 102 mg.",

To do so, we focus on scenarios when many smart devices compete for cellular resources in the same base station: spreading out transmissions over time so that only a few devices transmit at once and improves both spectral efficiency and battery consumption. To this end, we devise two novel features in CASTLE. First, we explicitly consider inter-cell interference for accurate cellular load estimation in our machine learning algorithm. Second, we propose a fully distributed scheduling algorithm that coordinates transmissions between clients based on the locally estimated load level at each client. Our formulation for minimizing battery consumption at each device leads to an optimized back off-based algorithm that fits practical environments. Our comprehensive experimental results show that CASTLE's load estimation is up to 91 % accurate, and that CASTLE achieves higher spectral efficiency with less battery consumption, compared to existing centralized scheduling algorithms as well as a distributed CSMA-like protocol. Furthermore,we develop a light-weight SDK that can expedite the deployment of CASTLE into smart devices and evaluate it in a commercial LTE network.",

To this end, we propose to exploit the TV white space (TVWS) spectrum for its attractive properties: low cost, abundance in under-served regions and favorable propagation characteristics. Specifically, we propose a system called WhiteHaul for the efficient aggregation of the TVWS spectrum tailored for the backhaul use case. At the core of WhiteHaul are two key innovations: (i) a TVWS conversion substrate that can efficiently handle multiple non-contiguous chunks of TVWS spectrum using multiple low cost 802.11n/ac cards but with a single antenna; (ii) novel use of MPTCP as a link-level tunnel abstraction and its use for efficiently aggregating multiple chunks of the TVWS spectrum via a novel uncoupled, cross-layer congestion control algorithm. Through extensive evaluations using a prototype implementation of WhiteHaul, we show that: (a) WhiteHaul can aggregate almost the whole of TV band with 3 interfaces and achieve nearly 600Mbps TCP throughput; (b) the WhiteHaul MPTCP congestion control algorithm provides an order of magnitude improvement over state of the art algorithms for typical TVWS backhaul links. We also present additional measurement and simulation based results to evaluate other aspects of the WhiteHaul design.",

                    "abstract": "Low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs) are a compelling answer to the networking challenges faced by many Internet of Things devices. Their combination of low power, long range, and deployment ease has motivated a flurry of research, including exciting results on backscatter and interference cancellation that further lower power budgets and increase capacity. But despite the interest, we argue that unlicensed LPWAN technologies can only serve a narrow class of Internet of Things applications due to two principal challenges: capacity and coexistence. We propose a metric, bit flux, to describe networks and applications in terms of throughput over a coverage area. Using bit flux, we find that the combination of low bit rate and long range restricts the use case of LPWANs to sparse sensing applications. Furthermore, this lack of capacity leads networks to use as much available bandwidth as possible, and a lack of coexistence mechanisms causes poor performance in the presence of multiple, independently-administered networks. We discuss a variety of techniques and approaches that could be used to address these two challenges and enable LPWANs to achieve the promise of ubiquitous connectivity.",

Recent research shows that single-channel LPWANs suffer from scalability issues. While multiple channels improve these issues, data transmission is expensive. Furthermore, recent research has shown that jointly decoding raw physical layers that are offloaded by LPWAN gateways in the cloud can improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of week radio signals. However, when it comes to multiple channels, this approach requires high bandwidth of network infrastructure to transport a large amount of PHY samples from gateways to the cloud server, which results in network congestion and high cost due to Internet data usage. In order to reduce the operation's bandwidth, we propose a novel LPWAN packet acquisition mechanism based on Compressive Sensing with a custom design dictionary that exploits the structure of LPWAN packets, reduces the bit rate of samples on each gateway, and demodulates PHY in the cloud with (joint) sparse approximation. Moreover, we propose an adaptive compression method that takes the Spreading Factor (SF) and SNR into account. Our empirical evaluation shows that up to 93.7% PHY samples can be reduced by Nephelai when SF = 9 and SNR is high without degradation in the packet reception rate (PRR). With four gateways, 1.7x PRR can be achieved with 87.5% PHY samples compressed, which can extend the battery lifetime of embedded IoT devices to 1.7.",

                    "abstract": "Mobile apps that use sensors to monitor user behavior often employ resource heavy inference algorithms that make computational offloading a common practice. However, existing schedulers/offloaders typically emphasize one primary offloading aspect without fully exploring complementary goals (e.g., heterogeneous resource management with only partial visibility into underlying algorithms, or concurrent sensor app execution on a single resource) and as a result, may overlook performance benefits pertinent to sensor processing.We bring together key ideas scattered in existing offloading solutions to build LEO -- a scheduler designed to maximize the performance for the unique workload of continuous and intermittent mobile sensor apps without changing their inference accuracy. LEO makes use of domain specific signal processing knowledge to smartly distribute the sensor processing tasks across the broader range of heterogeneous computational resources of high-end phones (CPU, co-processor, GPU and the cloud). To exploit short-lived, but substantial optimization opportunities, and remain responsive to the needs of near real-time apps such as voice-based natural user interfaces, LEO runs as a service on a low-power co-processor unit (LPU) to perform both frequent and joint schedule optimization for concurrent pipelines. Depending on the workload and network conditions, LEO is between 1.6 and 3 times more energy efficient than conventional cloud offloading with CPU-bound sensor sampling. In addition, even if a general-purpose scheduler is optimized directly to leverage an LPU, we find LEO still uses only a fraction (&lt; 1/7) of the energy overhead for scheduling and is up to 19% more energy efficient for medium to heavy workloads.",

We propose a real-time audio-based system that uses deep learning for not only detecting but also ranging and localization of a drone. In the proposed system scenario, each node records sound and sends it to the server after processing, and the server receives the data from each node and computes the final location of a drone. To explore the design space and investigate the feasibility of real-time acoustic ranging using deep learning, we first measure the drone detection accuracy and processing latency using two deep learning models (CNN, DNN) on both an embedded and a server-class device. By analyzing the relationship between detection probability and distance measurement, and comparing between binary and multi-class classification, we suggest a system design to range and localize the drone.",

In the paper, we present a lightweight timestamp-based message authentication code method, called as TMAC. Based on TMAC and the time synchronization technique, the proposed detection scheme can not only resist pollution attacks but also defend replay attacks simultaneously. Finally",

Fine-grained atomic mobile services are not so convenient for end users to reuse. Considering that in identical or similar service domains, a great deal of the business logics and functions are reusable within the scope. So we present a template-based framework to allow reuse of services and to achieve rapid mobile application development. The reusable fine-grained service logics and functions are encapsulated into comparatively coarse-grained templates, from which the designers can create the personalized composite services and edit the templates efficiently.",

The onset or progression of diseases like obesity, diabetes, and metabolic disorder are strongly related to eating behavior, and scientists are still trying to fully understand the complex mixture of diet, exercise, genetics, sociocultural context, and physical environment that lead to these diseases. Health science, however, has no effective means for automatically measuring eating behavior in free-living conditions. The Auracle aims to be a wearable earpiece that detects eating behavior, to be fielded by health-science researchers in their efforts to study eating behavior and ultimately to develop interventions useful to individuals striving to address chronic disease related to eating.",

However, most of the existing PIR-based localization systems only utilize the binary information of PIR sensors and therefore require a large number of carefully deployed PIR sensors. A few works directly map the raw data of PIR sensors to one's location using machine learning approaches. However, these data-driven approaches require abundant training data and suffer from environmental change. In this paper, we propose PIRATES, a PIR-based device-free localization system based on the raw data of PIR sensors. The key of PIRATES is to extract a new type of location information called azimuth change. The extraction of the azimuth change relies on the physical properties of PIR sensors. Therefore, no abundant training data are needed and the system is robust to environmental change. Through experiments, we demonstrate that PIRATES can achieve higher localization accuracy than the state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, the information of the azimuth change can be easily incorporated with other information of PIR signals (e.g. amplitude) to improve the localization accuracy.",

With every passing year, the diversity of applications (apps) being supported by mobile platforms is growing manyfold. In addition, Android, the most popular handheld OS in the market is releasing a new version every year, with a newer and richer set of APIs, enabling the next generation of feature-rich applications. To support these apps, hardware requirements of these devices are increasing rapidly. Mobile SoCs need a larger number of faster cores, better GPUs and above all, higher DRAM capacities to do justice to user experience. To augment capacity requirements, non-volatile memories (NVMs) have been proposed as a potential addition to LPDDR variants, which have been the mainstay of mobile SoCs. However, few tools exist to carry out architectural design space exploration of main memory hierarchies featuring NVMs for newer Android and app versions. In this paper, we present META, a trace based tool for facilitating the exploration of memory hierarchies in mobile devices. META uses an enhanced version of Android emulator for generating raw instruction traces. These traces are then fed into a cache hierarchy and memory simulation modules to carry out design space exploration for a wide variety of apps and memory technologies.",

Previous works based on either specialized or commercial hardware all require multiple links, preventing their wide adoption in scenarios like homes where typically only one single AP is installed. The key insight underlying Widar2.0 to circumvent the use of multiple links is to leverage multi-dimensional signal parameters from one single link. To this end, we build a unified model accounting for Angle-of-Arrival, Time-of-Flight, and Doppler shifts together and devise an efficient algorithm for their joint estimation. We then design a pipeline to translate the erroneous raw parameters into precise locations, which first finds parameters corresponding to the reflections of interests, then refines range estimates, and ultimately outputs target locations. Our implementation and evaluation on commodity WiFi devices demonstrate that Widar2.0 achieves better or comparable performance to state-of-the-art localization systems, which either use specialized hardwares or require 2 to 40 Wi-Fi links.",

                    "abstract": "We present SparSDR, a resource-efficient architecture for softwaredefined radios whose backhaul bandwidth and compute power requirements scale in inverse proportion to the sparsity (in time and frequency) of the signals received. SparSDR requires dramatically fewer resources than existing approaches to process many popular protocols while retaining both flexibility and fidelity. We demonstrate that our approach has negligible impact on signal quality, receiver sensitivity, and processing latency. The SparSDR architecture makes it possible to capture signals across bandwidths far wider than the capacity of a radio's backhaul through the addition of lightweight frontend processing and corresponding backend reconstruction to restore the signals to their original sample rate. We employ SparSDR to develop two wideband applications running on a USRP N210 and a Raspberry Pi 3+: an IoT sniffer that scans 100 MHz of bandwidth and decodes received BLE packets, and a wideband Cloud SDR receiver that requires only residential-class Internet uplink capacity. We show that our SparSDR implementation fits in the constrained resources of popular low-cost SDR platforms, such as the AD Pluto.",

Recently, the ARM architecture has come into the spotlight of cache side-channel attacks with its unprecedented growth in the market.We propose SmokeBomb, a novel cache side-channel mitigation that functions by explicitly ensuring a private space for each process to safely access sensitive data. The heart of the idea is to use the L1 cache of the CPU core as a private space by which SmokeBomb can give consistent results against cache attacks on the sensitive data, and thus, an attacker cannot distinguish specific data used by the victim. Our experimental results show that SmokeBomb can effectively prevent currently formalized cache attack methods.",

                    "abstract": "Charging mobile devices \"fast\" has been the focus of both industry and academia, leading to the deployment of various fast charging technologies. However, existing fast charging solutions are agnostic of users' available time for charging their devices, causing early termination of the intended/planned charging. This, in turn, accelerates the capacity fading of device battery and thus shortens the device operation. In this paper, we propose a novel user-interactive charging paradigm, called iCharge, that tailors the device charging to the user's real-time availability and need. The core of iCharge is a relaxation-aware (R-Aware) charging algorithm that maximizes the charged capacity within the user's available time and slows down the battery's capacity fading. iCharge also integrates R-Aware with existing fast charging algorithms via a user-interactive interface, allowing users to choose a charging method based on their availability and need. We evaluate iCharge via extensive laboratory experiments and field-tests on Android phones, as well as user studies. R-Aware is shown to slow down the battery fading by more than 36% on average, and up to 60% in extreme cases, when compared to existing fast charging algorithms. This slowdown of capacity fading translates to, for instance, an up to 2-hour extension of the LTE time for a Nexus 5X phone after its use for 2 years, according to our trace-driven analysis of 976 device charging cases of 7 users over 3 months.",

In this paper, we present MagHacker, a new sensing system that realizes such eavesdropping attack over commodity mobile devices, which monitor and analyze the magnetic field being produced by the stylus pen's internal magnet. MagHacker divides the continuous magnetometer readings into small segments that represent individual letters, and then translates these readings into writing trajectories for letter recognition. Experiment results over realistic handwritings from multiple human beings demonstrate that MagHacker can accurately eavesdrop more than 80% of handwriting with stylus pens, from a distance of 10cm. Only slight degradation in such accuracy is produced when the eavesdropping distance or the handwriting speed increases. MagHacker is highly energy efficient, and can well adapt to different stylus pen models and environmental contexts.",

The required aperture, power consumption, and hardware complexity of the traditional array-based spatial sensing techniques make them unsuitable for small and power-constrained IoT devices. Aiming to overcome these fundamental limitations, Owlet explores acoustic microstructures for extracting spatial information. It uses a carefully designed 3D-printed metamaterial structure that covers the microphone. The structure embeds a direction-specific signature in the recorded sounds. Owlet system learns the directional signatures through a one-time in-lab calibration. The system uses an additional microphone as a reference channel and develops techniques that eliminate environmental variation, making the design robust to noises and multipaths in arbitrary locations of operations. Owlet prototype shows 3.6\u00b0 median error in DoA estimation and 10cm median error in source localization while using a 1.5cm \\texttimes{} 1.3cm acoustic structure for sensing. The prototype consumes less than 100th of the energy required by a traditional microphone array to achieve similar DoA estimation accuracy. Owlet opens up possibilities of low-power sensing through 3D-printed passive structures.",

                    "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) enables smartphone users to interact with virtual content spatially overlaid on a continuously captured physical world. Under the current permission enforcement model in popular operating systems, AR apps are given Internet permission at installation time, and request camera permission and external storage write permission at runtime through a user's approval. With these permissions granted, any Internet-enabled AR app could silently collect camera frames and derived visual information for malicious intent without a user's awareness. This raises serious concerns about the disclosure of private user data in their living environments.To give users more control over application usage of their camera frames and the information derived from them, we introduce LensCap, a split-process app design framework, in which the app is split into a camera-handling visual process and a connectivity-handling network process. At runtime, LensCap manages secured communications between split processes, enacting fine-grained data usage monitoring. LensCap also allows both processes to present interactive user interfaces. With LensCap, users can decide what forms of visual data can be transmitted to the network, while still allowing visual data to be used for AR purposes on device. We prototype LensCap as an Android library and demonstrate its usability as a plugin in Unreal Engine. Performance evaluation results on five AR apps confirm that visual privacy can be preserved with an insignificant latency penalty (&lt; 1.3 ms) at 60 FPS.",

Such applications often adopt deep-learning algorithms such as CNN and RNN to extract rich contextual information from the first-person-view video streams. Despite the high accuracy, use of deep learning algorithms in mobile devices raises critical challenges, i.e., high processing latency and power consumption. In this paper, we propose DeepMon, a mobile deep learning inference system to run a variety of deep learning inferences purely on a mobile device in a fast and energy-efficient manner. For this, we designed a suite of optimization techniques to efficiently offload convolutional layers to mobile GPUs and accelerate the processing; note that the convolutional layers are the common performance bottleneck of many deep learning models. Our experimental results show that DeepMon can classify an image over the VGG-VeryDeep-16 deep learning model in 644ms on Samsung Galaxy S7, taking an important step towards continuous vision without imposing any privacy concerns nor networking cost.",

State-of-the-art VLBC systems employ COTS LCD shutter as optical modulator, whose slow response fundamentally throttles its data rate to sub-Kbps, and limits its deployment at scale for use cases where higher rate and/or low latency is a necessity.We design and implement RetroTurbo, a VLBC system dedicated for turboboosting data rate. At the heart of RetroTurbo design is a pair of novel modulation schemes, namely delayed superimposition modulation (DSM) and polarization-based QAM (PQAM), to push the rate limit by strategically coordinating the state of a liquid crystal modulator (LCM) pixel array in time and polarization domains. Specifically, DSM ensures we fully exploit the available SNR for high order modulation in the LCM-imposed nonlinear channel; PQAM is based on polarized light communication that creates a QAM design in polarization domain with flexible angular misalignment between two ends. A real-time near-optimal demodulation algorithm is designed to ensure system's robustness to heterogeneous signal distortion. Based on our prototyped system, RetroTurbo demonstrates 32x and 128x rate gain via experiments and emulation respectively in practical real-world indoor setting.",

Currently used low-power protocols such as Zigbee and Bluetooth Low Energy have limited communication range, whereas long-range communication strategies used in cellular and satellite networks are heavy on energy consumption. Methods that use narrow-band communication such as LoRa, SigFox, and NB-IoT have low spectral efficiency, leading to scalability issues. The goal of this work is to develop a communication framework that can satisfy the following requirements: (1) Increased battery life, (2) Longer communication range, (3) Scalability in a wireless network. In this work, we propose, design, and prototype WiChronos, a communication paradigm that encodes information in the time interval between two narrowband symbols in order to drastically reduce the energy consumption in a wide area network with a large number of senders. We leverage the low data-rate and relaxed latency requirements of such applications to achieve the desired features identified above. Based on our prototype using off-the-shelf components, WiChronos achieves an impressive 60% improvement in battery life compared to state-of-the-art LPWAN technologies at distances of over 800 meters. We also show that more than 1000 WiChronos senders can co-exist with less than 5% probability of collisions under low traffic conditions.",

Result shows that the potential solution space is huge. This underconstrained nature fundamentally challenges the achievement of accurate and real-time arm skeleton tracking. In this study, we propose Hidden Markov Model (HMM) state reorganization and hierarchical search two methods to improve the heavyweight computation of the state-of-art arm tracking model and achieve real-time tracking even on mobile phone.",

CoLTE is a lightweight, Internet-only LTE core network (EPC) based on OpenAirInterface. CoLTE is designed to facilitate the deployment and operation of small-scale, community owned and operated LTE networks, with a particular eye towards expanding Internet access into rural areas with limited and unreliable backhaul. CoLTE comes paired with a basic, IP-based network manager called Haulage, as well as basic locally-hosted webservices. The key differentiator of CoLTE, when compared to existing LTE solutions, is that in CoLTE the EPC is designed to be located in the field and deployed alongside a small number of cellular radios (eNodeBs), as opposed to the centralized model seen in large-scale telecom networks.",

Leveraging the widespread presence of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) in high-end and mobile devices, we utilize TEEs on clients for local training, and on servers for secure aggregation, so that model/gradient updates are hidden from adversaries. Challenged by the limited memory size of current TEEs, we leverage greedy layer-wise training to train each model's layer inside the trusted area until its convergence. The performance evaluation of our implementation shows that PPFL can significantly improve privacy while incurring small system overheads at the client-side. In particular, PPFL can successfully defend the trained model against data reconstruction, property inference, and membership inference attacks. Furthermore, it can achieve comparable model utility with fewer communication rounds (0.54\\texttimes{}) and a similar amount of network traffic (1.002\\texttimes{}) compared to the standard federated learning of a complete model. This is achieved while only introducing up to ~15% CPU time, ~18% memory usage, and ~21% energy consumption overhead in PPFL's client-side.",

This problem is typically formulated as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. Today's practice relies on hand-tuned heuristics from human experts to address the scalability challenge of ILP solvers.In this paper, we propose NeuroPlan, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to solve the network planning problem. This problem involves multi-step decision making and cost minimization, which can be naturally cast as a deep RL problem. We develop two important domain-specific techniques. First, we use a graph neural network (GNN) and a novel domain-specific node-link transformation for state encoding, in order to handle the dynamic nature of the evolving network topology during planning decision making. Second, we leverage a two-stage hybrid approach that first uses deep RL to prune the search space and then uses an ILP solver to find the optimal solution. This approach resembles today's practice, but avoids human experts with an RL agent in the first stage. Evaluation on real topologies and setups from large production networks demonstrates that NeuroPlan scales to large topologies beyond the capability of ILP solvers, and reduces the cost by up to 17% compared to hand-tuned heuristics.",

But each advance has created its own challenges, including pollution, overcrowding, sprawl. As the digital revolution transforms cities once again, how can we make sure it improves quality of life while minimizing the downside? With population density comes the possibility of deploying network connectivity and wayfinding at lower cost, but density also increases complexity of deployment. How can digital technology reduce the bad friction of urban environments, such as congestion, cost, and complexity, while increasing good friction, such as all of the serendipitous interactions that cities encourage? Underlying all this change is ubiquitous connectivity and mobile technology, from the phones people carry with them to the supporting devices and network endpoints embedded in the urban infrastructure. Sidewalk Labs is an Alphabet company that works with cities to develop new technology that can improve urban life. We will discuss some of our discoveries and beliefs, and talk about our plans to use mobile technology to help cities take full advantage of the digital revolution.",

However, static permissions cannot detect stealthy malware with update attacks capability, while dynamic network traffic cannot detect the malware samples without network connectivity. Hence, there is a need to build a hybrid model combining both these attributes. In this work, we propose a hybrid malware detector that examines both the permissions and the traffic features to detect malicious Android samples. The proposed approach is based on the combination of Supervised Learning (KNN Algorithm) and Unsupervised Learning (K-Medoids Algorithm). Experimental results demonstrate that hybrid approach gives the overall detection accuracy of 91.98%, better than static and dynamic detection accuracies of 71.46% and 81.13% respectively.",

Well beyond providing information, such agents can serve as physical and mental health and education coaches and companions that support positive behavior change. However, sustaining user engagement and motivation over long-term interactions presents complex challenges. Our work over the past 15 years has addressed those challenges by developing human-machine (human-robot) interaction methods for socially assistive robotics that utilize multi-modal interaction data and expressive agent behavior to monitor, coach, and motivate users to engage in heath- and wellness-promoting activities. This talk will present methods and results of modeling, learning, and personalizing user motivation, engagement, and coaching of healthy children and adults, as well as stroke patients, Alzheimer's patients, and children with autism spectrum disorders, in short and long-term (month+) deployments in schools, therapy centers, and homes, and discuss research and commercial implications for technologies aimed at human daily use.",

CoLTE is a lightweight, Internet-only LTE core network (EPC) designed to facilitate the deployment and operation of small-scale, community owned and operated LTE networks in rural areas with limited and unreliable backhaul. The key differentiator of CoLTE, when compared to existing LTE solutions, is that in CoLTE the EPC is designed to be located in the field and deployed alongside a small number of cellular radios (eNodeBs), as opposed to the centralized model seen in large-scale telecom networks. We also provide performance results and lessons learned from a real-world CoLTE network deployed in rural Indonesia. This network has been sustainably operating for over six months, currently serves over 40 active users, and provides measured backhaul reductions of up to 45% when compared to cloud-core solutions.",

                    "abstract": "Global Positioning System (GPS) is used ubiquitously in a wide variety of applications ranging from navigation and tracking to modern smart grids and communication networks. However, it has been demonstrated that modern GPS receivers are vulnerable to signal spoofing attacks. For example, today it is possible to change the course of a ship or force a drone to land in a hostile area by simply spoofing GPS signals. Several countermeasures have been proposed in the past to detect GPS spoofing attacks. These counter-measures offer protection only against naive attackers. They are incapable of detecting strong attackers such as those capable of seamlessly taking over a GPS receiver, which is currently receiving legitimate satellite signals, and spoofing them to an arbitrary location. Also, there is no hardware platform that can be used to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of existing countermeasures in real-world scenarios.In this work, we present SPREE, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first GPS receiver capable of detecting all spoofing attacks described in the literature. Our novel spoofing detection technique called auxiliary peak tracking enables detection of even a strong attacker capable of executing the seamless takeover attack. We implement and evaluate our receiver against three different sets of GPS signal traces: (i) a public repository of spoofing traces, (ii) signals collected through our own wardriving effort and (iii) using commercial GPS signal generators. Our evaluations show that SPREE constraints even a strong attacker (capable of seamless takeover attack) from spoofing the receiver to a location not more than 1 km away from its true location. This is a significant improvement over modern GPS receivers that can be spoofed to any arbitrary location. Finally, we release our implementation and datasets to the community for further research and development.",

It supports a broad array of applications through either passive or active sensing using only a single sensor. In the passive sensing, the received vibration signals are determined by the location of the touch impact. This allows location discrimination of touches precise enough to enable emerging applications such as virtual keyboards on ubiquitous surfaces for mobile devices. Moreover, in the active mode, the received vibration signals carry richer information of the touching object's characteristics (e.g., weight, size, location and material). This further enables our work to match the signals to the trained profiles and allows it to differentiate personal objects in contact with any surface. We evaluated extensively in the use cases of localizing touches (i.e., virtual keyboards), object localization and identification. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed vibration-based solution can achieve high accuracy, over 95%, in all these use cases.",

This paper proposes a novel system, NFC+, to overcome the fundamental challenges. NFC+ is a magnetic field reader, which can inventory standard NFC tagged objects with a reasonably long range and arbitrary orientation. NFC+ achieves this by leveraging physical and algorithmic techniques based on magnetic resonance engineering. We build a prototype of NFC+ and conduct extensive evaluations in a logistic network. Comparing to UHF RFID, we find that NFC+ can reduce the miss-reading rate from 23% to 0.03%, and cross-reading rate from 42% to 0, for randomly oriented objects. NFC+ demonstrates high robustness for RFID unfriendly media (e.g., water bottles and metal cans). It can reliably read commercial NFC tags at a distance of up to 3 meters which, for the first time, enables NFC to be directly applied to practical logistics network applications.",

                    "abstract": "Cellular service providers add carriers in the network in order to support the increasing demand in voice and data traffic and provide good quality of service to the users. Addition of new carriers requires the network operators to accurately configure their parameters for the desired behaviors. This is a challenging problem because of the large number of parameters related to various functions like user mobility, interference management and load balancing. Furthermore, the same parameters can have varying values across different locations to manage user and traffic behaviors as planned and respond appropriately to different signal propagation patterns and interference. Manual configuration is time-consuming, tedious and error-prone, which could result in poor quality of service. In this paper, we propose a new data-driven recommendation approach Auric to automatically and accurately generate configuration parameters for new carriers added in cellular networks. Our approach incorporates new algorithms based on collaborative filtering and geographical proximity to automatically determine similarity across existing carriers. We conduct a thorough evaluation using real-world LTE network data and observe a high accuracy (96%) across a large number of carriers and configuration parameters. We also share experiences from our deployment and use of Auric in production environments.",

The lack of interpretability makes DL-based networking systems prohibitive to deploy in practice. In this paper, we propose Metis, a framework that provides interpretability for two general categories of networking problems spanning local and global control. Accordingly, Metis introduces two different interpretation methods based on decision tree and hypergraph, where it converts DNN policies to interpretable rule-based controllers and highlight critical components based on analysis over hypergraph. We evaluate Metis over two categories of state-of-the-art DL-based networking systems and show that Metis provides human-readable interpretations while preserving nearly no degradation in performance. We further present four concrete use cases of Metis, showcasing how Metis helps network operators to design, debug, deploy, and ad-hoc adjust DL-based networking systems.",

                    "abstract": "In industrialized wine production, brewing and aging are two key steps. These two processes require the liquors to be bottled for a long time, sometimes more than ten years. The liquor is vulnerable and highly susceptible to microbial contamination during storage, causing undetectable deterioration. During the production process, wineries control the indoor temperature and carbon dioxide concentration to slow down other microorganisms' reproduction speed. These methods, however, do not prevent pathogenic microorganism growth. Currently, microbial culture methods are not suitable for real-time liquor quality monitoring in wineries. Therefore, we have designed a lightweight monitoring system called Lili, which uses light signals to monitor real-time liquor quality changes. Lili detects the changes in surface tension and absorption spectrum caused by microbial metabolites and growth during deterioration. Lili employs eight LEDs and one photodiode to achieve fine-grained surface tension and absorption spectrum measurements. By analyzing these changes, Lili realizes real-time quality monitoring. In this paper, the characteristic offset degree measurement and the absorption spectrum dimension expansion are two critical technologies. In addition, we implemented countermeasures against ambient light noise and sloshing interference. Lili's surface tension and absorption spectrum measurement errors are only 0.89 mN/m and 2.4%, respectively, making it useful to identify the contamination duration, microorganism content and microorganism composition. These two data points can be used to determine potential issues with liquor quality when the liquor becomes health-threatening or even just contaminated, with an accuracy of 97.5%.",

ArmTroi can achieve real-time 3D arm skeleton tracking and reliable gesture inference tolerant to missing wearable sensors for enabling numerous useful application designs. We have coped with two major challenges through ArmTroi. First, the skeleton of each arm is determined from the locations of the elbow and wrist, whereas a wearable device only senses a single point from the wrist. We find that the potential solution space is huge. This underconstrained nature fundamentally challenges the achievement of accurate and real-time arm skeleton tracking. Second, wearable sensors may not reliably provide sensory data. For example, devices are not worn by the user, yet the learning tools for gesture inference, such as deep learning, typically have static network structures, which require nontrivial network adaptation to match the input's varying availability and ensure reliable gesture inference. We propose effective techniques to address above challenges, and all computations can be conducted on the user's smartphone. ArmTroi is thus a fully lightweight and portable system. We develop a prototype and extensive evaluation shows the efficacy of the ArmTroi design.",

Existing defenses do not provide a practical solution as they either rely on external hardware or work under very constrained settings. We introduce a hand gesture-based authentication system for smart home voice assistants called HandLock, which uses built-in microphones and speakers to generate and sense inaudible acoustic signals to detect the presence of a known hand gesture. Our proposed approach can act as a second-factor authentication (2-FA) for performing specific sensitive operations like confirming online purchases through voice assistants. The experiments involving 45 participants show that HandLock can achieve on average 96.51% true-positive-rate at the expense of 0.82% false-acceptance-rate.",

Besides, attackers often produce novel malware to bypass the conventional detection approaches, which are largely reliant on expert analysis to design the discriminative features manually. Therefore, more effective and easy-to-use approaches for detection of Android malware are in demand. In this paper, we design and implement EasyDefense, a lightweight defense system that is integrated with Android OS for easy and effective detection of Android malware utilizing machine learning methods and the ensemble of them. Besides universal static features such as permissions and API calls, EasyDefense also employs the N-gram features of operation codes (opcodes). These N-gram features are extracted and learnt automatically from raw data of applications. Experimental results on 204,650 applications show that users can easily and effectively protect the privacy and security on their smartphones through this system.",

In this demo, we propose RF-iCare, an RFID-based approach for monitoring the infusion status, including the liquid level and the drop speed. With a tag array attached on the infusion bottle, we design an RSSI-based signal match model to estimate the liquid level. With a tag attached on the Murphy's dropper, we leverage the phase variation of the tag to estimate the drop speed. We implement RF-iCare with a COTS RFID system and evaluate it in the real-world hospitals. Our experiments demonstrate that RF-iCare can accurately monitor the completion of the infusion over 91% tests, and estimate the liquid level with the mean accuracy of 0.8 cm as well as the drop speed with the error rate less than 3%.",

However, the obscurity of decisions by DRL policies renders it hard to ascertain that learning-augmented systems are safe to deploy, posing a significant obstacle to their real-world adoption. We observe that specific characteristics of recent applications of DRL to systems contexts give rise to an exciting opportunity: applying formal verification to establish that a given system provably satisfies designer/user-specified requirements, or to expose concrete counter-examples. We present whiRL, a platform for verifying DRL policies for systems, which combines recent advances in the verification of deep neural networks with scalable model checking techniques. To exemplify its usefulness, we employ whiRL to verify natural equirements from recently introduced learning-augmented systems for three real-world environments: Internet congestion control, adaptive video streaming, and job scheduling in compute clusters. Our evaluation shows that whiRL is capable of guaranteeing that natural requirements from these systems are satisfied, and of exposing specific scenarios in which other basic requirements are not.",

This paper focuses on adding user localization as a new capability to voice assistants. For any voice command, we desire Alexa to be able to localize the user inside the home. The core challenge is two-fold: (1) accurately estimating the AoAs of multipath echoes without the knowledge of the source signal, and (2) tracing back these AoAs to reverse triangulate the user's location.We develop VoLoc, a system that proposes an iterative align-and-cancel algorithm for improved multipath AoA estimation, followed by an error-minimization technique to estimate the geometry of a nearby wall reflection. The AoAs and geometric parameters of the nearby wall are then fused to reveal the user's location. Under modest assumptions, we report localization accuracy of 0.44 m across different rooms, clutter, and user/microphone locations. VoLoc runs in near real-time but needs to hear around 15 voice commands before becoming operational.",

In this paper, we show that existing congestion-free mechanisms, notably FFC, achieve performance far short of the network's intrinsic capability. We propose PCF, a set of novel congestion-free mechanisms to bridge this gap. PCF achieves these goals by better modeling network structure, and by carefully enhancing the flexibility of network response while ensuring that the performance under failures can be tractably modeled. All of PCF's schemes involve relatively light-weight operations on failures, and many of them can be realized using a local proportional routing scheme similar to FFC. We show PCF's effectiveness through formal theoretical results, and empirical experiments over 21 Internet topologies. PCF's schemes provably out-perform FFC, and in practice, can sustain higher throughput than FFC by a factor of 1.11X to 1.5X on average across the topologies, while providing a benefit of 2.6X in some cases.",

Based on the idea of transmitting data by modulating light, we are able to (1) share a secret key within a constrained physical space and (2) leverage this shared key to communicate encrypted information among co-located mobile devices. In this demonstration, we showcase our complete implementation of Jive: a VLC transmitter and a VLC receiver. Both endpoints are built using off-the-shelf components. The VLC link is used to distribute a randomly generated secret key that can only be \"observed\" by VLC receivers that are physically in the same space as the transmitter. Each receiver is connected over a serial connection to an Android device; we developed applications for Android that take the key from the VLC receiver and subsequently use the key to encrypt or decrypt application data. Our demo invites participants to create their own encrypted messages in the Android application and interact with the VLC prototype as it transmits encryption keys, thus illustrating our system's ability to bootstrap security among physically co-located devices.",

Traffic congestion avoiding can be achieved by knowing traffic flow and then conducting transportation planning. Achieving traffic flow prediction is challenging as the prediction is affected by many complex factors such as inter-region traffic, vehicles' relations, and sudden events. However, as the mobile data of vehicles has been widely collected by sensor-embedded devices in transportation systems, it is possible to predict the traffic flow by analysing mobile data. This study proposes a deep learning based prediction algorithm, DeepTFP, to collectively predict the traffic flow on each and every traffic road of a city. This algorithm uses three deep residual neural networks to model temporal closeness, period, and trend properties of traffic flow. Each residual neural network consists of a branch of residual convolutional units. DeepTFP aggregates the outputs of the three residual neural networks to optimize the parameters of a time series prediction model. Contrast experiments on mobile time series data from the transportation system of England demonstrate that the proposed DeepTFP outperforms the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture based method in prediction accuracy.",

Wearable devices, in particular, require new modes for interaction -- many have no keyboard or touchscreen. In this work, we focus on user authentication on wearable devices. For an entertainment device, such as a VR headset, it can recognize the user and load the right game profile or music playlist. For a house climate-control system, it can adjust the environment to the wearer's preference. Most compellingly, for a health-monitoring device, it can label the sensor data with the correct identity so that the data can be stored in the correct health record. (A mix-up of sensor data could lead to incorrect decisions, with harm to the patient.) Because not all devices are personal devices -- my phone, your fitness sensor -- many devices will need to automatically recognize their wearer. They may have no interface for user identification (or PIN or password for authentication). Thus, we need a simple, wearable biometric technique to identify the user -- which could be embedded in one authentication device that shares the identity with a body-area network of other devices (earlier confirmed to be on the same body). This device should be trained once, for each user that might wear it, but thenceforth be completely automatic. Although a wristband could use a physiological biometric to recognize its wearer; we seek an alternative biometric, notably, one that might work for devices mounted on the head, neck, or chest.",

To alleviate this issue, this work presents WiBeacon, which repurposes ubiquitously deployed WiFi access points (AP) into virtual BLE beacons via only moderate software upgrades. Specifically, a WiBeacon-enabled AP can broadcast elaborately designed WiFi packets that could be recognized as iBeacon-compatible location identifiers by unmodified mobile BLE devices. This offers fast deployment of BLE LBS with zero additional hardware costs and low maintenance burdens. WiBeacon is carefully integrated with native WiFi services, retaining transparency to WiFi clients. We implement WiBeacon on commodity WiFi APs (with various chipsets such as Qualcomm, Broadcom, and MediaTek) and extensively evaluate it across various scenarios, including a real commercial application for courier check-ins. During the two-week pilot study, WiBeacon provides reliable services, i.e., as robust as conventional BLE beacons, for 697 users with 150 types of smartphones.",

In addition to respiratory droplet spreading, a common mode of contraction of this virus is when individuals touch their face after coming into contact with a contaminated surface. In this poster, we leverage near-field communication (NFC) and propose a system design, NoFaceContact, which can promptly warn users when they attempt to touch their face with the aim of helping to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and improve overall hygiene. A proof-of-concept experiment shows that NoFaceContact can achieve an average communication distance of 8.07 cm and can potentially detect a wide range of face touching poses.",

As the modern world receives &amp; sends millions of Terabytes of data every day, the present-day wireless data communication technologies comprising of Wi-Fi &amp; 4G-LTE is on the verge of becoming partially inept for information exchange as they suffer from spectrum congestion in both controlled and uncontrolled environments. Li-Fi, also known as light fidelity, is a full duplex communication network enabling transmittal of data. The potency of bidirectional Visible Light Communication allows us to build an ideal medium, independent of congested radio frequencies and interference from electromagnetic waves, thus, resulting in faster data transfer. Inception of LED technology for lighting in 90's paved the way for high growth trajectory for LED Lighting industry which we have witnessed from the last 2 decades. As semiconductors, LEDs were poised to develop much bigger applications like integrated sensors apart from normal dimming and ambient lighting. Li-Fi is a technology which creates a bridge between the world of data communication &amp; LED Lighting. Multiple forward &amp; backward integration are poised to happen in coming years when lighting players will develop enterprise communication enabled lighting products. Even system integrators will look forward to Li-Fi enabled luminaires for establishing wireless networks. Li-Fi is being seen as a big step forward in enabling 5G telecommunication networks. Security benefits and outdoor long-range communication capabilities Li-Fi a potential technology for Defence &amp; Smart Cities applications. Li-Fi uses the visible and invisible frequency band (380nm - 1500nm) which is 10,000 times broader than usable RF frequency band. The property of light spectrum to be unlicensed and free from any health regulations makes it even more desirable for us. Its applications can extend in areas where the RF technology lacks its presence like aircrafts and hospitals (operation theatres), power plants and various other areas, where electromagnetic (Radio) interference is of great concern for safety and security of equipment's and people. Since there is no potential health hazard associated with light, it can be used safely in such locations or areas. Li-Fi / OWC has applications in both indoor (\u2245) and outdoor ( ) scenarios.",

Today's systems commonly rely on dedicated infrastructure to track the controller or only provide inertial-based rotational tracking, which severely limits the user experience. Optical inside-out systems offer mobility but require line-of-sight and bulky tracking rings, which limit the ubiquity of these devices. In this work, we present Aura, an inside-out electromagnetic 6-DoF tracking system for handheld controllers. The tracking system consists of three coils embedded in a head-mounted display and a set of orthogonal receiver coils embedded in a handheld controller. We propose a novel closed-form and computationally simple tracking approach to reconstruct position and orientation in real time. Our handheld controller is small enough to fit in a pocket and consumes 45 mW of power, allowing it to operate for multiple days on a typical battery. An evaluation study demonstrates that Aura achieves a median tracking error of 5.5 mm and 0.8 degrees in 3D space within arm's reach.",

The goal of our work is to ensure system correctness and security against the harmful effects of errata and their workarounds. The first step is to systematically understand them in the wild.In this poster, we present our early results from analyzing errata in the ARM Cortex-A family of microarchitecture, introduced by ARM itself, and their workarounds.

In the last two decades, many cities have adopted policies to control the emission of pollutants to the atmosphere as well as to promote sustainable urban developments. However, many of these initiatives have concluded that a long term success would require investing in the environmental literacy of the general population. In this demonstration paper, we present USC AiR, a mobile application that translates the air quality sensor feeds from the CCITI smart campus testbed into augmented reality visualizations for the USC community. USC AiR also allows users to report alarming air quality conditions and recommend environmental interventions such as planting trees. We believe that the integration of augmented reality for air quality monitoring enables the citizens to become more engaged with the air quality data while encouraging them to contribute to the reduction of anthropogenic air pollutants.",

Given the wide-spreading, steady diffusion of ear-worn wearables (Earables) as the new frontier of wearable devices, we investigate the feasibility of earable-based gait identification. Specifically, we look at gait-based identification from the sounds induced by walking and propagated through the musculoskeletal system in the body. Our system, EarGate, leverages an in-ear facing microphone which exploits the earable's occlusion effect to reliably detect the user's gait from inside the ear canal, without impairing the general usage of earphones. With data collected from 31 subjects, we show that EarGate achieves up to 97.26% Balanced Accuracy (BAC) with very low False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 3.23% and 2.25%, respectively. Further, our measurement of power consumption and latency investigates how this gait identification model could live both as a stand-alone or cloud-coupled earable system.",

We re-envision this area by combining wireless communication with acoustics. The core idea is to scatter IoT devices in the environment that listen to ambient sound and forward it over their wireless radio. Since wireless signals travel much faster than sound, the ear-device receives the sound much earlier than its actual arrival. This \"glimpse\" into the future allows sufficient time for acoustic digital processing, serving as a valuable opportunity for various signal processing and machine learning applications. We believe this will enable a digital app store around human ears.",

QBP reduces the LDPC decoding to a discrete optimization problem, then embeds that reduced design onto quantum annealing hardware. QBP's embedding design can support LDPC codes of block length up to 420 bits on real state-of-the-art QA hardware with 2,048 qubits. We evaluate performance on real quantum annealer hardware, performing sensitivity analyses on a variety of parameter settings. Our design achieves a bit error rate of 10--8 in 20 \u03bcs and a 1,500 byte frame error rate of 10--6 in 50 \u03bcs at SNR 9 dB over a Gaussian noise wireless channel. Further experiments measure performance over real-world wireless channels, requiring 30 \u03bcs to achieve a 1,500 byte 99.99% frame delivery rate at SNR 15-20 dB. QBP achieves a performance improvement over an FPGA based soft belief propagation LDPC decoder, by reaching a bit error rate of 10--8 and a frame error rate of 10--6 at an SNR 2.5--3.5 dB lower. In terms of limitations, QBP currently cannot realize practical protocol-sized (e.g., Wi-Fi, WiMax) LDPC codes on current QA processors. Our further studies in this work present future cost, throughput, and QA hardware trend considerations.",

We introduce SociTrack, a platform for autonomous social interaction tracking via wireless distance measurements. Deployments require no supporting infrastructure and provide sub-second, decimeter-accurate ranging information over multiple days. The key insight that enables both deployability and fidelity in one system is to decouple node mobility and network management from range measurement, which results in a novel dual-radio architecture. SociTrack leverages an energy-efficient and scalable ranging protocol that is accurate to 14.8 cm (99th percentile) in complex indoor environments and allows our prototype to operate for 12 days on a 2000 mAh battery. Finally, to validate its deployability and efficacy, SociTrack is used by early childhood development researchers to capture caregiver-infant interactions.",

Existing methods for calibrating IMU tracking either require human in the loop, or need energy-consuming cameras, or suffer from coarse tracking granularity. We propose to augment indoor inertial tracking by reusing existing indoor luminaries to project a static light polarization pattern in the space. This pattern is imperceptible to human eyes and yet through a polarizer, it becomes detectable by a color sensor, and thus can serve as fine-grained optical landmarks that constrain and correct IMU's integration drift and boost tracking accuracy. Exploiting the birefringence optical property of transparent tapes -- a low-cost and easily-accessible material -- we realize the polarization pattern by simply adding to existing light cover a thin polarizer film with transparent tape stripes glued atop. When fusing with IMU sensor signals, the light pattern enables robust, accurate and low-power motion tracking. Meanwhile, our approach entails low deployment overhead by reusing existing lighting infrastructure without needing an active modulation unit. We build a prototype of our light cover and the sensing unit using off-the-shelf components. Experiments show 4.3 cm median error for 2D tracking and 10 cm for 3D tracking, as well as its robustness in diverse settings.",

However, today's evolved packet core (EPC) that orchestrates the LTE RAN faces fundamental limitations in catering to such a challenging, wireless and mobile UAV environment, particularly in the presence of multiple BSs (UAVs). In this work, we argue for and propose an alternate, radical edge EPC design, called SkyCore that pushes the EPC functionality to the extreme edge of the core network - collapses the EPC into a single, light-weight, self-contained entity that is co-located with each of the UAV BS. SkyCore incorporates elements that are designed to address the unique challenges facing such a distributed design in the UAV environment, namely the resource-constraints of UAV platforms, and the distributed management of pronounced UAV and UE mobility. We build and deploy a fully functional version of SkyCore on a two-UAV LTE network and showcase its (i) ability to interoperate with commercial LTE BSs as well as smartphones, (ii) support for both hotspot and standalone multi-UAV deployments, and (iii) superior control and data plane performance compared to other EPC variants in this environment.",

To prevent unauthorized access on these devices, existing user verification solutions either rely on the complexity of user-defined secrets (e.g., password) or resort to specialized biometric sensors (e.g., fingerprint reader), but the users may still suffer from various attacks, such as password theft, shoulder surfing, smudge, and forged biometrics attacks. In this paper, we propose, CardioCam, a low-cost, general, hard-to-forge user verification system leveraging the unique cardiac biometrics extracted from the readily available built-in cameras in mobile and IoT devices. We demonstrate that the unique cardiac features can be extracted from the cardiac motion patterns in fingertips, by pressing on the built-in camera. To mitigate the impacts of various ambient lighting conditions and human movements under practical scenarios, CardioCam develops a gradient-based technique to optimize the camera configuration, and dynamically selects the most sensitive pixels in a camera frame to extract reliable cardiac motion patterns. Furthermore, the morphological characteristic analysis is deployed to derive user-specific cardiac features, and a feature transformation scheme grounded on Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is developed to enhance the robustness of cardiac biometrics for effective user verification. With the prototyped system, extensive experiments involving $25$ subjects are conducted to demonstrate that CardioCam can achieve effective and reliable user verification with over $99%$ average true positive rate (TPR) while maintaining the false positive rate (FPR) as low as $4%$.",

Elf's novelty centers on planning the camera's count actions under energy constraint. (1) Elf explores the rich action space spanned by the number of sample image frames and the choice of per-frame object counters; it unifies errors from both sources into one single bounded error. (2) To decide count actions at run time, Elf employs a learning-based planner, jointly optimizing for past and future videos without delaying result materialization. Tested with more than 1,000 hours of videos and under realistic energy constraints, Elf continuously generates object counts within only 11% of the true counts on average. Alongside the counts, Elf presents narrow errors shown to be bounded and up to 3.4X smaller than competitive baselines. At a higher level, Elf makes a case for advancing the geographic frontier of video analytics.",

                    "abstract": "Although communication networks have been constantly evolving and increasing their capacity with state-of-the-art solutions, it is still hard to provide reliable and high capacity communications in some cases referred to as challenged networks. In these networks, ensuring performance guarantees is hard either due to the lack of infrastructure or its limitations, such as in public safety networks, or due to the challenging communication medium, such as in mmWave networks. Challenged networks face now new constraints with the proliferation of services and applications, increasing number of connected devices, the high computing and control demands, unpredicted human behavior, and only partially-available information. CHANTS'19 aims at bringing researchers together to have a platform for discussing the challenges emerging with new use cases and real-life applications, such as edge computing or autonomous driving, and corresponding innovative approaches in tackling the limitations of the challenged networks. Moreover, this workshop aims at providing another perspective to the broader audience by listing a subset of problems that communication networks, despite the advances on many fronts, still have to tackle. The expected outcomes of CHANTS'19 have the potential to influence industrial thinking about the technologies of next-generation challenged networks.",

                    "abstract": "Due to extremely low power consumption, backscatter has become the transmission mechanism of choice for battery-free devices that operate on harvested energy. However, a limitation of recent backscatter systems is that the communication range scales with the strength of the ambient carrier signal~(ACS). This means that to achieve a long-range, a backscatter tag needs to reflect a strong ACS, which in practice means that it needs to be close to an ACS emitter. We present TunnelScatter, a mechanism that overcomes this limitation. TunnelScatter uses a tunnel diode-based radio frequency oscillator to enable transmissions when there is no ACS, and the same oscillator as a reflection amplifier to support backscatter transmissions when the ACS is weak. Our results show that even without an ACS, TunnelScatter is able to transmit through several walls covering a distance of 18m while consuming a peak biasing power of SI57 microwatt. Based on TunnelScatter, we design battery-free sensor tags, called TunnelTags, that can sense physical phenomena and transmit them using the TunnelScatter mechanism.",

Several of these verticals, however, expect high availability of multiple nines. This paper leverages end-to-end measurements to investigate the potential of current mobile broadband networks to support these expectations. We conduct a large-scale measurement study of network availability in four networks in Norway. This study is based on three years of measurements from hundreds of stationary measurement nodes and several months of measurements from four mobile nodes. We find that the mobile network centralized architecture and infrastructure sharing between operators are responsible for a non-trivial fraction of network failures. Most episodes of degraded availability, however, are uncorrelated. We also find that using two networks simultaneously can result in more than five nines of availability for stationary nodes and three nines of availability for mobile nodes. Our findings point to potential avenues for enhancing the availability of future mobile networks.",

Especially, the market share of smartphone with android system account for 84% in 2016[1]. Under android system, a large of privacy data (e.g. photos or videos) are stored in external storage (emulated Sdcard storage), which can be accessed by installed apps. This not only results in privacy leakage but also incurs ransomware attack[2] (e.g. simplocker). Therefore, we present Sdguard, an app, can implement fine-grain permission control based on Linux DAC mechanism and detect ransomware which encrypts content of file stored in external storage or lock user screen. To install Sdguard app, we need to ensure that the smartphone has been rooted and use FUSE filesystem on external storage. During installing, sdcard daemon of android (i.e. FUSE daemon) is replaced by our customized sdcard daemon. After rebooting system, the customized daemon is loaded, and each component of Sdguard is running.",

Unlike existing service sharing systems (e.g., ridesharing), the delivery of food in FooDNet is more time-sensitive and the optimization problem is more complex regarding high-efficiency, huge-number of delivery needs. In particular, we study the food delivery problem in association with the Opportunistic Online Takeout Ordering &amp; Delivery service (O-OTOD). Specifically, the food is delivered incidentally by taxis when carrying passengers in the O-OTOD problem, and the optimization goal is to minimize the number of selected taxis to maintain a relative high incentive to the participated drivers. The two-stage method is proposed to solve the problem, consisting of the construction algorithm and the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithm. Preliminary experiments based on real-world taxi trajectory datasets verify that our proposed algorithms are effective and efficient.",

                    "abstract": "The popularity of 4K videos has grown significantly in the past few years. Yet coding and streaming live 4K videos incurs prohibitive cost to the network and end system. Motivated by this observation, we explore the feasibility of supporting live 4K video streaming over wireless networks using commodity devices. Given the high data rate requirement of 4K videos, 60 GHz is appealing, but its large and unpredictable throughput fluctuation makes it hard to provide desirable user experience. In particular, to support live 4K video streaming, we should (i) adapt to highly variable and unpredictable wireless throughput, (ii) support efficient 4K video coding on commodity devices. To this end, we propose a novel system, Jigsaw. It consists of (i) easy-to-compute layered video coding to seamlessly adapt to unpredictable wireless link fluctuations, (ii) efficient GPU implementation of video coding on commodity devices, and (iii) effectively leveraging both WiFi and WiGig through delayed video adaptation and smart scheduling. Using real experiments and emulation, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our system. Our results show that it improves PSNR by 6-15dB and improves SSIM by 0.011-0.217 over state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, even when throughput fluctuates widely between 0.2Gbps-2Gbps, it can achieve an average PSNR of 33dB.",

Recent work has investigated the impact of the AP's location on the received signal strength of clients [1], and has shown that a 1:7x throughput improvement can be achieved by simply moving the AP in a 2ft. x 2ft. region. The benefits of small scale AP mobility is chiefly caused by mitigating multipath effects. In fact, the multipath effect has a significant impact on network performance and can be dramatically altered even with mere centimeter level movement of a Tx or a Rx. In this work, we investigate how network throughput performance can be improved if the AP is able to adapt its orientation. We consider two types of orientation changes - that of the AP's base platform (base orientation), and that of its antennas (antenna orientation). We show using experimental analysis that network throughput performance can be improved 1:8x by simply adapting AP's orientation.",

However, today's solutions lack the ability to render follow-up effects attached to moving anchors since they fail to track the 6 degrees of freedom (6-DoF) poses of them. We find an opportunity to accomplish the task by leveraging sensors capable of generating sparse point clouds on smartphones and fusing them with vision-based technologies. However, realizing this vision is non-trivial due to challenges in modeling radar error distributions and fusing heterogeneous sensor data. This study proposes FollowUpAR, a framework that integrates vision and sparse measurements to track object 6-DoF pose on smartphones. We derive a physical-level theoretical radar error distribution model based on an in-depth understanding of its hardware-level working principles and design a novel factor graph competent in fusing heterogeneous data. By doing so, FollowUpAR enables mobile devices to track anchor's pose accurately. We implement FollowUpAR on commodity smartphones and validate its performance with 800,000 frames in a total duration of 15 hours. The results show that FollowUpAR achieves a remarkable rotation tracking accuracy of 2.3\u00b0 with a translation accuracy of 2.9mm, outperforming most existing tracking systems and comparable to state-of-the-art learning-based solutions. FollowUpAR can be integrated into ARCore and enable smartphones to render follow-up AR effects to moving objects.",

Pain-O-Vision is a smartwatch enabled pain management system that uses computer vision to capture the details of painful events from the user. A natural reaction to pain is to clench ones fist. The embedded camera is used to capture different types of fist clenching, to represent different levels of pain. An initial prototype was built on an Android smartwatch that uses a cloud-based classification service to detect the fist clench gestures. Our results show that it is possible to map a fist clench to different levels of pain which allows the patient to record the intensity of a painful event without carrying a specialized pain management device.",

Our technique allows third-party developers to modify, instrument, or extend platform API calls and deploy their modifications seamlessly. The uniqueness of our technique is that it enables modifications completely at the app layer without requiring any platform-level changes. This allows practical openness---third parties can easily distribute their modifications for a platform without the need to update the entire platform. To demonstrate the benefits of our technique, we have developed a prototype on Android called Reptor and used it to instrument real-world apps with novel functionality. Our evaluation in realistic scenarios shows that Reptor has little overhead in performance and energy, and only modest overhead in memory usage that ranges from 0.6% to 10% for the observed worst cases.",

However, there do not exist any mmWave radio platforms with phased arrays available to the networking community. All existing mmWave platforms use horn antennas which require mechanical steering and are not suitable for non-static links or multi-user networks. We have built MiRa: a full-fledged mmWave radio with phased arrays capable of beam steering. MiRa operates as a daughterboard for the USRP software radio which enables easy manipulation of mmWave signals using standard GNU-radio software. With its reconfigurable architecture, steerable phased arrays and open SDR platform, MiRa can help advance mmWave research in the mobile and networking community.",

Despite a large number of efforts to enhance user quality of experience (QoE) both at the ingest and distribution side of live video, the fundamental limitations are that streamer's upstream bandwidth and computational capacity limit the quality of experience of thousands of viewers.To overcome this limitation, we design LiveNAS, a new live video ingest framework that enhances the origin stream's quality by leveraging computation at ingest servers. Our ingest server applies neural super-resolution on the original stream, while imposing minimal overhead on ingest clients. LiveNAS employs online learning to maximize the quality gain and dynamically adjusts the resource use to the real-time quality improvement. LiveNAS delivers high-quality live streams up to 4K resolution, outperforming WebRTC by 1.96 dB on average in Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio on real video streams and network traces, which leads to 12%-69% QoE improvement for live stream viewers.",

However, their reliance on oscillators for generating the frequency-shifting signal on the tag, forces them to incur the transient phase of the oscillator before steady-state operation. We show how the oscillator's transient phase can pose a fundamental limitation for battery-less tags, resulting in significantly low bandwidth efficiencies, thereby limiting their practical usage.To this end, we propose a novel approach to FS-backscatter called xSHIFT that shifts the core functionality of FS away from the tag and onto the commodity device, thereby eliminating the need for on-tag oscillators altogether. The key innovation in xSHIFT lies in addressing the formidable challenges that arise in making this vision a reality. Specifically, xSHIFT's design is built on the construct of beating twin carrier tones through a non-linear device to generate the desired FS signal - while the twin RF carriers are generated externally through a careful embedding into the resource units of commodity WiFi transmissions, the beating is achieved through a carefully-designed passive tag circuitry. We prototype xSHIFT's tag, which is the same form factor as RFID Gen 2 tags, and characterize its promising real-world performance. We believe xSHIFT demonstrates one of the first, truly passive tag designs that has the potential to bring commodity backscatter to consumer spaces.",

                    "abstract": "Many mobile applications deliver and show sensitive and private textual content to users including messages, social network posts, account information, and verification codes. All such textual content must only be displayed to the user but must be strongly protected from unauthorized access in the device. Unfortunately, this is not the case in mobile devices today: malware that can compromise the operating system, e.g., gain root or kernel privileges, can easily access textual content of other applications. In this paper, we present SchrodinText, a system solution for strongly protecting the confidentiality of application's selected UI textual content from a fully compromised operating system. SchrodinText leverages a novel security monitor based on two hardware features on modern ARM processors: virtualization hardware and TrustZone. Our key contribution is a set of novel techniques that allow the operating system to perform the text rendering without needing access to the text itself, hence minimizing the Trusted Computing Base (TCB). These techniques, collectively called oblivious rendering, enable the operating system to rasterize and lay out all the characters without access to the text; the monitor only resolves the right character glyphs onto the framebuffer observed by the user and protects them from the operating system, e.g., against DMA attacks. We present our prototype using an ARM Juno development board and Android operating system. We show that SchrodinText incurs noticeable overhead but that its performance is usable.",

In this work, a relay-node selection method is proposed for mobility-tolerant data forwarding. The proposed relay-node selection method uses the connectivity information in time-varying networks. The connectivity information of IoT devices is modelled using homogeneous Poisson point processes. The connectivity duration information of all the devices with their neighbours is updated continuously. Based on connectivity information, an optimal relay-node is selected as a data forwarding node. The online relay-node selection from a source node to the base station establishes a data forwarding path. The proposed method selects the relay-nodes based on joint optimization of two network parameters, data latency and packet loss risk. The simulation results show that the proposed method significantly improves the data latency and the packet loss risk for data forwarding over time-varying IoT networks.",

The key impediment here is the effort to manually align the product barcode with the scanner, requiring sequential handling of items without blocking the line-of-sight of the laser beam. While recent systems such as Amazon Go eliminate human involvement using an extensive array of cameras, we propose a privacy-preserving alternative, RFGo, that identifies products using passive RFID tags. Foregoing continuous monitoring of customers throughout the store, RFGo scans the products in a dedicated checkout area that is large enough for customers to simply walk in and stand until the scan is complete (in two seconds). Achieving such low-latency checkout is not possible with traditional RFID readers, which decode tags using one antenna at a time. To overcome this, RFGo includes a custom-built RFID reader that simultaneously decodes a tag's response from multiple carrier-level synchronized antennas enabling a large set of tag observations in a very short time. RFGo then feeds these observations to a neural network that accurately distinguishes the products within the checkout area from those that are outside. We build a prototype of RFGo and evaluate its performance in challenging scenarios. Our experiments show that RFGo is extremely accurate, fast and well-suited for practical deployment in apparel stores.",

To address this problem, this paper proposes a software-defined solution, namely, MasQ, which is short for \"queue masquerade\". The core insight of MasQ is that all RDMA communications should associate with at least one queue pair (QP). Thus, the requirements of virtualization, such as network isolation and the application of security rules, can be easily fulfilled if QP's behavior is properly defined. In particular, MasQ exploits the virtio-based paravirtualization technique to realize the control path. Moreover, to avoid performance overhead, MasQ leaves all data path operations, such as sending and receiving, to the hardware. We have implemented MasQ in the OpenFabrics Enterprise Distribution (OFED) framework and proved its scalability and performance efficiency by evaluating it against typical applications. The results demonstrate that MasQ achieves almost the same performance as bare-metal RDMA for data communication.",

This involves monitoring the overall energy consumption of a facility and the individual energy consumption of each device. This is usually done by using multiple energy meters. Minion, a hand sized energy auditing device, has the ability to analyze multiple devices' energy consumption without the need of multiple energy meters. This allows valuable actionable insights for non-intrusive energy management solution. Minion captures voltage and energy signatures at microsecond intervals and uses machine learning techniques to identify the individual assets used and the patterns of their consumption. Minion enables energy transparency, energy savings of up to 30%, predictive maintenance and asset health monitoring, This provides accurate and rapid analysis of multiple energy signatures at any given point.",

Unleashing those capabilities can enable innovative applications on off-the-shelf devices. In this work, we demonstrate how to transmit raw IQ samples from a large buffer on Wi-Fi chips. We further show how to extract channel state information (CSI) on a per frame basis. As a proof-of-concept application, we build a covert channel on top of Wi-Fi to stealthily exchange information between two devices by prefiltering Wi-Fi frames prior to transmission. On the receiver side, the CSI is used to extract the embedded information. By means of experimentation, we show that regular Wi-Fi clients can still demodulate the underlying Wi-Fi frames. Our results show that covert channels on the physical layer are practical and run on off-the-shelf smartphones. By making available our raw signal transmitter, the CSI extractor, and the covert channel application to the research community, we ensure reproducibility and offer a platform for further innovative applications on Wi-Fi devices.",

However, existing works use only the coarse-grained packet-level information for cross-technology modulation, suffering from a low throughput (e.g., 10bps). Our approach, called BlueBee, aims at achieving much higher CTC throughput thus extends CTC applications. We pro- poses a new direction by emulating legitimate ZigBee frames using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio. Uniquely, BlueBee achieves dual-standard compliance (i.e., BLE and ZigBee) and transparency by selecting only the payload of Bluetooth frames, requiring neither hardware nor firmware changes at the BLE senders and ZigBee receivers. Our implementation on commodity device testbeds shows that BlueBee can achieve a more than 99% accuracy and a through- put 10,000x faster than the state-of-the-art CTC reported so far. In addition, we show a demo of using BlueBee on a smartphone to control several smart light bulbs a ached with ZigBee radio.",

                    "abstract": "In recent years, the explosion of diverse smart devices such as mobile phones, TVs, watches, and even cars, has completely changed our lives. We communicate with friends through social network services (SNSs) whenever we want, buy stuff without visiting shops, and enjoy multimedia wherever we are, thanks to these devices. However, these smart devices cannot simply interact with each other even though they are right next to each other. For example, when you want to read a PDF stored on a smartphone on a larger TV screen, you need to do complicated work or plug in a bunch of cables. In this paper, we introduce M+, an extension of Android that supports cross-device functionality sharing in a transparent manner. As a platform-level solution, M+ enables unmodified Android applications to utilize not only application functionalities but also system functionalities across devices, as if they were to utilize them inside the same device. In addition to secure connection setup, M+ also allows performing of permission checks for remote applications in the same way as for local. Our experimental results show that M+ enables transparent cross-device sharing for various functionalities and achieves performance close to that of within-device sharing unless a large amount of data is transferred.",

However, to this date, it is not clear how these tools compare to one another, as they have been evaluated on arbitrary, disjointed set of Android apps, for which there is no ground truth, i.e., verified set of event races. To fill this gap and support future research in this area, we introduce BenchERoid, a set of 34 Android apps with injected event-race bugs. The current version of benchmark contains 36 types of event-race bugs that were identified by analyzing Android concurrency literature and publicly available issue repositories. We believe that our framework is a valuable resource for both developers and researchers interested in concurrency bug analysis in Android. BenchERoid is publicly available at: https://github.com/seal-hub/bencheroid.",

Yet it is surprisingly difficult to deploy new services in Tor\u2014it is largely relegated to proxies and hidden services\u2014or to nimbly react to new forms of attack. Conversely, \u201cnon-anonymous\u201d Internet services are thriving like never before because of recent advances in programmable networks, such as Network Function Virtualization (NFV) which provides programmable in-network middleboxes.This paper seeks to close this gap by introducing programmable middleboxes into the Tor network. In this architecture, users can install and run sophisticated \u201cfunctions\u201d on willing Tor routers. We demonstrate a wide range of functions that improve anonymity, resilience to attack, performance of hidden services, and more. We present the design and implementation of an architecture, Bento, that protects middlebox nodes from the functions they run\u2014and protects the functions from the middleboxes they run on.We evaluate Bento by running it on the live Tor network. We show that, with just a few lines of Python, we can significantly extend the capabilities of Tor to meet users' anonymity needs and nimbly react to new threats. We will be making our code and data publicly available.",

In this paper, we explore the feasibility of the following re-search question:\u202f?Can commodity Wi-Fi radios detect both the location and type of moving objects around them?\". We present IntuWition, a complementary sensing system that can sense the location and type of material of objects in the environment, including those out of line-of-sight. It achieves this by sensing wireless signals reflected off surrounding objects using commodity Wi-Fi radios, whose signals penetrate walls and occlusions. At the core of IntuWition is the idea that different materials reflect and scatter polarized waves in different ways. We build upon ideas from RADAR Polarimetry to detect the material of objects across spatial locations, despite mobility of the sensing device and the hardware non-idealities of commodity Wi-Fi radios. A detailed feasibility study reveals an average accuracy of 95% in line-of-sight and 92% in non-line-of-sight in classifying five types of materials:copper, aluminum, plywood, birch, and human. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept application of our system on an autonomous UAV that uses its onboard Wi-Fi radios to sense whether an occlusion is a person versus another UAV.",

It integrates social media data of various sources, using a semantic classifier. Nowadays, people use multiple social media simultaneously, acquiring information with ease. However, accessing numerous services to reach different channels is bothersome. Also, the volume of information one can process is limited. Our aim is to reduce this burden, providing easiness and efficiency. In other words, we attempt to build a single service that integrates information from various platforms. The application has three main features. First, it enables users to explore multiple social media without accessing them separately. Second, it organizes information retrieved from social medias into well-defined classes. Finally, it works as a stand-alone application, the mechanism of which is internal to the device, not relying on any external servers or networks. This method respects user privacy, which has recently gained much attention.",

                    "abstract": "Full-duplex (FD) wireless can significantly enhance spectrum efficiency but requires tremendous amount of self-interference (SI) cancellation. Recent advances in the RFIC community enabled wideband RF SI cancellation (SIC) in integrated circuits (ICs) via frequency-domain equalization (FDE), where RF filters channelize the SI signal path. Unlike other FD implementations, that mostly rely on delay lines, FDE-based cancellers can be realized in small-form-factor devices. However, the fundamental limits and higher layer challenges associated with these cancellers were not explored yet. Therefore, and in order to support the integration with a software-defined radio (SDR) and to facilitate experimentation in a testbed with several nodes, we design and implement an FDE-based RF canceller on a printed circuit board (PCB). We derive and experimentally validate the PCB canceller model and present a canceller configuration scheme based on an optimization problem. We then extensively evaluate the performance of the FDE-based FD radio in the SDR testbed. Experiments show that it achieves 95dB overall SIC (52dB from RF SIC) across 20MHz bandwidth, and an average link-level FD gain of 1.87x. We also conduct experiments in: (i) uplink-downlink networks with inter-user interference, and (ii) heterogeneous networks with half-duplex and FD users. The experimental FD gains in the two types of networks confirm previous analytical results. They depend on the users' SNR values and the number of FD users, and are 1.14x-1.25x and 1.25x-1.73x, respectively. Finally, we numerically evaluate and compare the RFIC and PCB implementations and study various design tradeoffs.",

These SmartNIC JBOFs are shared among multiple co-resident applications, and there is a need for the platform to ensure fairness, QoS, and high utilization. Unfortunately, given the limited computing capability of the SmartNICs and the non-deterministic nature of NVMe drives, it is challenging to provide such support on today's SmartNIC JBOFs.This paper presents Gimbal, a software storage switch that orchestrates IO traffic between Ethernet ports and NVMe drives for co-located tenants. It enables efficient multi-tenancy on SmartNIC JBOFs using the following techniques: a delay-based SSD congestion control algorithm, dynamic estimation of SSD write costs, a fair scheduler that operates at the granularity of a virtual slot, and an end-to-end credit-based flow control channel. Our prototyped system not only achieves up to x6.6 better utilization and 62.6% less tail latency but also improves the fairness for complex workloads. It also improves a commercial key-value store performance in a multi-tenant environment with x1.7 better throughput and 35.0% less tail latency on average.",

These vibrations are strong enough to propagate to the edge of the face and produce vibratory signals at an earphone. By re-tasking the earphone speaker as an input transducer - a software modification in the sound card - we are able to sense teeth-related gestures across various models of ear/headphones. In fact, by analyzing the signals at the two earphones, we show the feasibility of also localizing teeth gestures, resulting in a human-to-machine interface. Challenges range from coping with weak signals, distortions due to different teeth compositions, lack of timing resolution, spectral dispersion, etc. We address these problems with a sequence of sensing techniques, resulting in the ability to detect 6 distinct gestures in real-time. Results from 18 volunteers exhibit robustness, even though our system - EarSense - does not depend on per-user training. Importantly, EarSense also remains robust in the presence of concurrent user activities, like walking, nodding, cooking and cycling. Our ongoing work is focused on detecting teeth gestures even while music is being played in the earphone; once that problem is solved, we believe EarSense could be even more compelling.",

However, sharing user's sensitive information with the ad servers may raise privacy concerns. As opposed to targeting users, mobile contextual advertising seeks to target the app page a user is viewing. In this demo, we present a novel mobile contextual advertising platform, called MoCA, which is designed to improve the semantic relevance of in-app ads in a stand-alone, privacy-protecting manner on mobile devices. MoCA understands the semantics of app page and ads, and then matches semantically relevant ads to the page inside mobile devices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to implement the mobile contextual advertising platform based on the semantic approach without resort to ad servers.",

Because the characteristics of these devices differ largely, people argue that future 5G systems should be designed to elastically accommodate to the different users. In this paper, we propose a reconfigurable core network called RECO that demonstrates how to implement customized virtual core network entities efficiently to suit for users with different characteristics. We then build a testbed to verify our proposed RECO architecture. Finally, we will open source our RECO in the near future so that the research community can take benefit out of it.",

This paper addresses the crowd estimation problem and builds an IoT service to share the crowd estimation results across different systems. The crowd estimation problem is to approximate the crowd size in a targeted area using the observed information (e.g., Wi-Fi data). This paper exploits Wi-Fi probe request packets (\"Wi-Fi probes\" for short) broadcasted by mobile devices to solve this problem. However, using only Wi-Fi probes to estimate the crowd size may result in inaccurate results due to various environmental uncertainties which may lead to crowd overestimation or underestimation. Moreover, the ground-truth is unavailable because the coverage of Wi-Fi signals is time-varying and invisible. This paper introduces auxiliary sensors, stereoscopic cameras, to collect the near ground-truth at a specified calibration choke point. Two calibration algorithms are proposed to solve the crowd estimation problem. The key idea is to calibrate the Wi-Fi-only crowd estimation based on the correlations between the two types of data modalities. Then, to share the calibrated results across systems required by different stakeholders, our system is integrated with the FIWARE-based IoT platform. To verify the proposed system, we have launched an indoor pilot study in the Wellington Railway Station and an outdoor pilot study in the Christchurch Re:START Mall in New Zealand. The large-scale pilot studies show that stereoscopic cameras can reach minimum accuracy of 85% and high precision detection for providing the near ground-truth. The proposed calibration algorithms reduce estimation errors by 43.68% on average compared to the Wi-Fi-only approach.",

                    "abstract": "Cross-technology Communication (CTC) is a key technique to explore the full capacity of heterogeneous wireless. The latest CTC designs explore the PHY-layer to reach the standards' maximum rate, but leaving a critical gap to practicality -- existing PHY-layer CTCs are commonly transmitter-side techniques requiring a high-end transmitter (with a high degree of freedom in signal manipulation) to emulate the receiver signal closely. This inherently limits the reverse direction (low-end to high-end) communication. We present XBee, a unique receiver-side CTC that fills in the gap and makes a critical step towards achieving CTC bidirectionality. XBee is demonstrated as a ZigBee to BLE communication, where the key innovation lies in the unique mechanism of cross-technology decoding, or cross-decoding in short, which interprets a ZigBee frame only by carefully observing the bit patterns obtained at the BLE receiver. Technically, XBee counterintuitively explores the sampling offset to overcome the intrinsic challenge due to BLE's narrower bandwidth (1MHz) than ZigBee (2MHz). Extensive implementation and evaluation on USRP and commodity devices reach 250 kbps under 85% reliability, a 15,000x improvement over state-of-the-art ZigBee to BLE communication, and comparable with the latest PHY-layer CTCs to achieve CTC bidirectionality.",

However, this fundamental concern has never been addressed due to the challenges of measuring cellular reliability on mobile devices and the cost of conducting large-scale measurements. This paper closes the knowledge gap by presenting the first large-scale, in-depth study on cellular reliability with more than 70 million Android phones across 34 different hardware models. Our study identifies the critical factors that affect cellular reliability and clears up misleading intuitions indicated by common wisdom. In particular, our study pinpoints that software reliability defects are among the main root causes of cellular data connection failures. Our work provides actionable insights for improving cellular reliability at scale. More importantly, we have built on our insights to develop enhancements that effectively address cellular reliability issues with remarkable real-world impact---our optimizations on Android's cellular implementations have effectively reduced 40% cellular connection failures for 5G phones and 36% failure duration across all phones.",

This paper presents a first systematic study on using the electromagnetic field (EMF) induced by a building's electric power network for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). A basis of this work is a measurement study showing that the power network EMF sensed by either a customized sensor or smartphone's microphone as a side-channel sensor is spatially distinct and temporally stable. Based on this, we design a SLAM approach that can reliably detect loop closures based on EMF sensing results. With the EMF feature map constructed by SLAM, we also design an efficient online localization scheme for resource-constrained mobiles. Evaluation in three indoor spaces shows that the power network EMF is a promising modality for location sensing on mobile devices, which is able to run in real time and achieve sub-meter accuracy.",

Since the music is caused by vibration and the vibration can influence the RF signal, our system could accurately recover the frequency of every tone, especially string instruments. Specifically, RF-DJ is immune to noises from the player/instrument motions and the ambient environment. Further more, it can recover the high frequency signal from the relatively low sampling rate data. In our demonstration, we put one tag on the surface of ukulele (not the string) and achieve the overall recognition accuracy of $93%, 90%, 87%, 81%$ when using 1,2,3,4 strings, respectively. Compared to typical machine learning based RF sensing systems, our system is model driven instead of data driven, which requires little training effort and could be applicable across different locations. Last but not the least, our system can also be used for other instruments such as zither, violin and kalimba and shows similarly good performances.",

It enables an HTTP client to fetch content (an HTTP object) over multiple network paths such as WiFi and cellular on smartphones. Compared to MPTCP, MP-H2 offers several key advantages including server transparency, middlebox compatibility, and friendliness to CDN, anycast, and load balancing. MP-H2 strategically splits the file into byte range requests sent over multipath, and dynamically balances the workload across all paths. Furthermore, MP-H2 leverages new features in HTTP/2 including stream multiplexing, flow control, and application-layer PING to boost the performance. MP-H2 also supports multi-homing where each path contacts a different CDN server for enhanced performance. Evaluations show that MP-H2 offers only slightly degraded performance (6% on average) while being much easier to deploy compared to MPTCP. Compared to other state-of-the-art HTTP multipath solutions, MP-H2 reduces the file download time by up to 47%, and increases the DASH video streaming bitrate by up to 44%.",

Existing router verification techniques cannot identify all differences or localize those differences to relevant configuration lines. Our approach addresses these limitations through a _modular_ analysis, which separately analyzes pairs of corresponding configuration components. It handles all router components that affect routing and forwarding, including configuration for BGP, OSPF, static routes, route maps and ACLs. Further, for many configuration components our modular approach enables simple _structural equivalence_ checks to be used without additional loss of precision versus modular semantic checks, aiding both efficiency and error localization. We implemented this approach in the tool Campion and applied it to debugging pairs of backup routers from different manufacturers and validating replacement of critical routers. Campion analyzed 30 proposed router replacements in a production cloud network and proactively detected four configuration bugs, including a route reflector bug that could have caused a severe outage. Campion also found multiple differences between backup routers from different vendors in a university network. These were undetected for three years, and depended on subtle semantic differences that the operators said they were \"highly unlikely\" to detect by \"just eyeballing the configs.\"",

Recent advances in the RFIC community enabled wideband RF SI cancellation (SIC) in integrated circuits (ICs) via frequency-domain equalization (FDE), where reconfigurable RF filters are used to channelize the SI signal path. In [2], we designed and implemented an FDE-based RF canceller on a printed circuit board (PCB). We also presented an optimized canceller configuration scheme based on the derived canceller model, and extensively evaluated the performance of the FDE-based FD radios in a software-defined radio (SDR) testbed in different network settings.",

These standards have been widely adopted for many applications, such as mobile payments, advertisements, social sharing, admission control, and so on. Recently, considerable demands require the integration of these two codes (barcode and NFC code) into a single tag for the functional complementation. To achieve the goal of \"one tag, two codes\" (OTTC), this work proposes CoilCode, which takes advantage of the printed electronics to fuse an NFC coil antenna into a QR code on a single layer. The proposed code could be identified by cameras and NFC readers. With the use of the conductive inks, QR code and NFC code have become an essential part of each other: the modules of the QR code facilitate the NFC chip in harvesting energy from the magnetic field, while the NFC antenna itself represents bits of the QR code. Compared to the prior dual-layer OTTC, CoilCode is more compact, cost-effective, flimsy, flexible, and environment-friendly, and also reduces the fabrication complexity considerably. We prototyped hundreds of CoilCodes and conducted comprehensive evaluations (across 4 models of NFC chips and 8 kinds of NFC readers under 13 different system configurations). CoilCode demonstrates high-quality identification results for QR code and NFC functions on a wide range of inputs and under different distortion effects.",

In this work, we developed a DNN model based on typing features to predict four emotion states (happy, sad, stressed, relaxed) and investigate its performance on a smartphone. The evaluation of the model in a 3-week study with 15 participants reveals that it can reliably detect emotions with an average accuracy of 80% with peak CPU utilization less than 15%.",

                    "abstract": "The popularity of 360\u00b0 videos has grown rapidly due to the immersive user experience. 360\u00b0 videos are displayed as a panorama and the view automatically adapts with the head movement. Existing systems stream 360\u00b0 videos in a similar way as regular videos, where all data of the panoramic view is transmitted. This is wasteful since a user only views a small portion of the 360\u00b0 view. To save bandwidth, recent works propose the tile-based streaming, which divides the panoramic view to multiple smaller sized tiles and streams only the tiles within a user's field of view (FoV) predicted based on the recent head position. Interestingly, the tile-based streaming has only been simulated or implemented on desktops. We find that it cannot run in real-time even on the latest smartphone (e.g., Samsung S7, Samsung S8 and Huawei Mate 9) due to hardware and software limitations. Moreover, it results in significant video quality degradation due to head movement prediction error, which is hard to avoid. Motivated by these observations, we develop a novel tile-based layered approach to stream 360\u00b0 content on smartphones to avoid bandwidth wastage while maintaining high video quality. Through real system experiments, we show our approach can achieve up to 69% improvement in user QoE and 49% in bandwidth savings over existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 360\u00b0 streaming framework that takes into account the practical limitations of Android based smartphones.",

We show how eTester evolved from an \"academic\" prototype to a fully automated tool usable by the mobile industry.We first present the design of our initial research prototype and discuss 8 key requirements for a usable battery drain testing and diagnostic tool gathered from some of the most popular software vendors in the Android ecosystem. These requirements posed interesting scientific and engineering challenges such as how to accurately estimate battery drain without requiring a priori power modeling, work on unmodified devices, and automatically monitor code evolution to generate high-fidelity battery spike alerts with actionable insights. These requirements motivated a complete overhaul of the eTester design and led to the creation of a novel battery drain testing methodology. We show how the redesigned eTester was used to effortlessly find battery bugs in some of the most popular Android apps with hundreds of millions of users, such as Netflix and CNN. We are open-sourcing eTester to encourage further research in battery diagnosis and to empower developers to write battery-efficient mobile software.",

                    "abstract": "Visible Light Communication (VLC) emerges as a new wireless communication technology with appealing benefits not present in radio communication. However, current VLC designs commonly require LED lights to emit perceptible light beams, which greatly limits the applicable scenarios of VLC (e.g., in a sunny day when indoor lighting is not needed), and brings high energy overhead and unpleasant visual experiences for mobile devices to transmit data using VLC. We design and develop DarkLight, a new VLC primitive that allows light-based communication to be sustained even when LEDs emit extremely-low luminance. The key idea is to encode data into ultra-short, imperceptible light pulses. We tackle challenges in circuit designs, data encoding/decoding schemes, and DarkLight networking, to efficiently generate and reliably detect ultra-short light pulses using off-the-shelf, low-cost LEDs and photodiodes. Our DarkLight prototype supports 1.3-m distance with 1.6-Kbps data rate. By loosening up VLC's reliance on visible light beams, DarkLight presents an unconventional direction of VLC and fundamentally broadens VLC's application scenarios.",

Hence, they are an attractive foundation for environmental sensing. Although RFID-based sensors have been studied in the research literature and are also available commercially, manufacturing them has been a technically-challenging task that is typically undertaken only by experienced researchers. In this paper, we show how even hobbyists can transform commodity RFID tags into sensors by physically altering (`hacking') them using COTS sensors, a pair of scissors, and clear adhesive tape. Importantly, this requires no change to commercial RFID readers. We also propose a new legacy-compatible tag reading protocol called Differential Minimum Response Threshold (DMRT) that is robust to the changes in an RF environment. To validate our vision, we develop RFID-based sensors for illuminance, temperature, touch, and gestures. We believe that our approach has the potential to open up the field of batteryless backscatter-based RFID sensing to the research community, making it an exciting area for future work.",

It employs customized clocking, channelization and interfacing modules, to achieve Gsps sampling bandwidth, Gbps wireless bit-rate, and Gsps sample streaming from/to a PC host. It also incorporates the first programmable, electronically steerable 60 GHz phased-array antenna. OpenMili adopts programming models that ease development, through automatic parallelization inside signal processing blocks, and modular, rate-insensitive interfaces across blocks. In this demo, we will showcase OpenMili's hardware modules, and demonstrate example communication and sensing applications based on it.",

In addition to mending network fragmentation, UAS applications include post-disaster data collection involving inoperative communication infrastructure [7, 8, 9], supplementing existing communication in- frastructure for vehicular networks [10], and rural applications in environmental monitoring [11, 12] and precision agriculture [13, 14].",

                    "abstract": "Mobile vision systems would benefit from the ability to situationally sacrifice image resolution to save system energy when imaging detail is unnecessary. Unfortunately, any change in sensor resolution leads to a substantial pause in frame delivery -- as much as 280 ms. Frame delivery is bottlenecked by a sequence of reconfiguration procedures and memory management in current operating systems before it resumes at the new resolution. This latency from reconfiguration impedes the adoption of otherwise beneficial resolution-energy tradeoff mechanisms. We propose Banner as a media framework that provides a rapid sensor resolution reconfiguration service as a modification to common media frameworks, e.g., V4L2. Banner completely eliminates the frame-to-frame reconfiguration latency (226 ms to 33 ms), i.e., removing the frame drop during sensor resolution reconfiguration. Banner also halves the end-to-end resolution reconfiguration latency (226 ms to 105 ms). This enables a more than 49% reduction of system power consumption by allowing continuous vision applications to reconfigure the sensor resolution to 480p compared with downsampling from 1080p to 480p, as measured in a cloud-based offloading workload running on a Jetson TX2 board. As a result, Banner unlocks unprecedented capabilities for mobile vision applications to dynamically reconfigure sensor resolutions to balance the energy efficiency and task accuracy tradeoff.",

                    "abstract": "Caches are at the heart of latency-sensitive systems. In this paper, we identify a growing challenge for the design of latency-minimizing caches called delayed hits. Delayed hits occur at high throughput, when multiple requests to the same object queue up before an outstanding cache miss is resolved. This effect increases latencies beyond the predictions of traditional caching models and simulations; in fact, caching algorithms are designed as if delayed hits simply didn't exist. We show that traditional caching strategies -- even so called 'optimal' algorithms -- can fail to minimize latency in the presence of delayed hits. We design a new, latency-optimal offline caching algorithm called belatedly which reduces average latencies by up to 45% compared to the traditional, hit-rate optimal Belady's algorithm. Using belatedly as our guide, we show that incorporating an object's 'aggregate delay' into online caching heuristics can improve latencies for practical caching systems by up to 40%. We implement a prototype, Minimum-AggregateDelay (mad), within a CDN caching node. Using a CDN production trace and backends deployed in different geographic locations, we show that mad can reduce latencies by 12-18% depending on the backend RTTs.",

The primary reason for this anomaly are the various overheads of channel access and channel state information (CSI) feedback. In order to achieve concurrent data transmission, (CSI) feedback from users is required. However, this overhead can easily overwhelm the actual channel time spent on data transmission in large-scale network. Moreover, due to spontaneous uplink traffic, which makes the problem even more challenging.In this paper, we propose a smart CSI feedback protocol called Gabriel. Firstly, Gabriel achieves alterable CSI feedback by evaluating its validity period to eliminate the unnecessary CSI feedback operation. Secondly, we introduce a new concept named 'large time slice' to solve fairness problem. Software-radio based implementation and testbed experimentation show that Gabriel significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CSI feedback reduction methods under various traffic patterns and node mobility.",

This paper presents ECC that uniquely enables explicit channel coordination among heterogeneities via cross-technology communication (CTC) introduced in the latest studies, while maintaining full compatibility to commodity devices. Unlike any implicit coordination designs adopting statistical models to probabilistically predict white spaces, ECC generates the white space using WiFi CTS, which is then explicitly notified to ZigBee through CTC for immediate use. Technical highlight of ECC lies in ensuring ZigBee communication under CTI, without disrupting WiFi operation. This is effectively achieved by the dynamic adjustment of CTS duration with respect to traffic amount and spectrum availability, which essentially enables ECC to be generally applied to various scenarios without prior knowledge. Lastly, ECC significantly reduces delay and energy in low duty cycled ZigBee, by waking them up upon channel availability (via CTC). We evaluate ECC on commercial platforms: Atheros AR2425 WiFi card and TelosB motes. Experiment results show that ECC achieves 1.8x ZigBee packet reception ratio, and cuts down delay and energy by 98.6% and 51% under the low duty cycle.",

We present a solution to this problem and, more generally, to the problem of routing on multiple optimality criteria. A key idea is the derivation of a partial order on path attributes that is consistent with the extension operation and respects every optimality criterion of a designated collection of such criteria. We design new vectoring protocols that compute on partial orders, with every node capable of electing multiple attributes per destination rather than a single attribute as in standard vectoring protocols. Our evaluation over publicly available network topologies and attributes shows that the proposed protocols converge fast and enable optimal path routing concurrently for many optimality criteria with only a few elected attributes at each node per destination. We further show how predicating computations on partial orders allows incorporation of service chain constraints on optimal path routing.",

We introduce the first contactless system that uses white noise to achieve motion and respiratory monitoring in infants. Our system is designed for smart speakers that can monitor an infant's sleep using white noise. The key enabler underlying our system is a set of novel algorithms that can extract the minute infant breathing motion as well as position information from white noise which is random in both the time and frequency domain. We describe the design and implementation of our system, and present experiments with a life-like infant simulator as well as a clinical study at the neonatal intensive care unit with five new-born infants. Our study demonstrates that the respiratory rate computed by our system is highly correlated with the ground truth with a correlation coefficient of 0.938.",

While such systems initially used reflected light as the communication media, direct light becomes the dominant media for the purpose of combating interference. Nonetheless, the data rate achievable by direct light LED-Camera VLC systems has hit its bottleneck: the dimension of the transmitters. In this demo, we revisit the reflected light approach and propose a novel modulation mechanism, ReflexCode, which converts the potentially destructive interferences into collaborative transmissions. Essentially, our ReflexCode system codes information by superposing light emissions from multiple transmitters. It combines traditional amplitude demodulation with slope detection to \"decode\" the grayscale modulated signal, and it tunes decoding thresholds dynamically depending on the spatial symbol distribution. In addition, ReflexCode re-engineers the balanced codes to avoid flicker from individual transmitters. We implement ReflexCode as a prototype and demonstrate that it can achieve a promising throughput.",

                    "abstract": "The growth rate of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices sold globally is constantly lower than the forecast. This deceleration is caused in part by the need for batteries and the scalability cost for their replacement. Backscatter has attracted significant interest over the past couple of years to enable sustainable sensing devices by eliminating batteries. IoT devices have been designed for transmitting sensed data with backscatter, but the question of efficient reception of data with battery-free devices is still open. As shown in this paper, classical low-power Radio Frequency (RF) envelope detectors are affected by low sensitivity, false detection alarms, and low energy efficiency. We argue that Light Fidelity (LiFi) can provide downlink and harvesting medium as LED lights are becoming pervasively deployed for illumination. We show, for the first time, that the advantages of LiFi and RF backscatter can be combined for battery-free communication. We design a low-power platform that leverages the complementary nature of these two mediums. We demonstrate that our platform removes energy-inefficiency in the downlink reception typical of RF backscatter, and significantly expands the deployment scenarios for battery-free tags when compared to conventional single-technology designs.",

GPS equipped smartphones are used to guide riders from points A to B, but GPS is known to have hundreds of meters of error in areas where the line of sight to navigation satellites is fully or partially obscured. To address this problem, we present ScootLoc, which enables precise e-scooter localization, by leveraging physical characteristics of sidewalk ramps, to correct for GPS error. We show that e-scooters equipped with a gyroscope and an accelerometer are able to uniquely identify sidewalk ramps and match the ramp to its physical location, thereby augmenting noisy GPS based navigation systems. We implement ScootLoc and present a preliminary evaluation on a route containing ten ramps, achieving 97% classification accuracy.",

There may be many reasons, but one of the reasons is that it has been developed for very specific users, such as researchers and professionals. To overcome this problem, Grubert et al. proposed the pervasive AR. It is not limited to a specific situation, but is usable in various instances and providing continuous and flexible AR experience. The AR browser is the example of utilizing pervasive AR. The AR browser understands the context of the user and provides corresponding information. However, if the corresponding information to the context of user cannot reach the user in time due to massive data transmission, unexpected network congestion, poor service quality or signal strength, it cannot be guaranteed to be continuous. This leads to a degradation of the user experience, and it cannot support pervasive AR. This paper presents the Progressive Augmented Reality, the way which quickly send incomplete, yet informative, response about the user's current context rather than wait for sending complete information to the user. The concept of Progressive Augmented Reality comes from Progressive Data Science. Our system is aware of network quality by collecting various network health parameters. According to the network status quality, it divides the chunk information to the optimal number and transmits the one that have the highest priority among the divided information. By conducting the above process iteratively, all the divided information is updated. Our client-side system utilizes Android ARCore and has been tested on Google Pixel 2XL.",

We make the following contributions: first, we establish that a significant portion of a user's YouTube watch behavior is indeed predictable by analyzing a real-life dataset of YouTube watch history spanning a 1-year period, from 206 users comprised of over 1.8 million videos; second, we develop an accurate prediction algorithm using a K-nearest neighbor classifier approach; and finally, we evaluate the prefetching algorithm on two different datasets and show that MANTIS is able to reduce the traffic during peak periods by 34% for a typical user.",

DopEnc performs encounter profiling in two major steps: (1) Doppler profiling to detect that two persons approach and stop in front of each other via an effective trajectory, and (2) voice profiling to confirm that they are thereafter engaged in an interactive conversation. DopEnc is further extended to support parallel acoustic exploration of many users by incorporating a unique multiple access scheme within the limited inaudible acoustic frequency band. All implementation of DopEnc is based on commodity sensors like speakers, microphones and accelerometers integrated on commercial-off-the-shelf smartphones. We evaluate DopEnc with detailed experiments and a real use-case study of 11 participants. Overall DopEnc achieves an accuracy of 6.9% false positive and 9.7% false negative in real usage.",

We envision a LED-to-smartphone VLC protocol for delivering messages to a group of unsynchronized mobile device receivers. We carefully design and implement our protocol, Martian, which allows smooth communication from the LED lights to a group of camera-enabled mobile devices. Across several phone models, Martian can achieve data rate of about 1.6kbps even with NLOS-light. Our intensive evaluations indicate that, the data rate reaches 4.2kbps on iPhone 6. This is a significant improvement compared with the 88bps data rate claimed by state-of-art design.",

Our work, named as WEBee, opens a promising direction for high throughput CTC via physical-level emulation. Specifically, WEBee synthesizes the time-domain signals by choosing appropriate frequency-domain components fed into the subcarriers of WiFi OFDM. WE-Bee can emulate the desired physical-layer ZigBee signals by manipulating only the data bits in WiFi packet payload, requiring neither hardware nor firmware changes in commodity technologies. Moreover, WEBee enables the parallel CTC, where one WiFi frame emulates two ZigBee frames simultaneously. To evaluate the performance, we implemented WEBee on commodity devices (the Atheros AR2425 WiFi card, BCM 4330 WiFi card and CC2420, CC2530 ZigBee devices). Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that WEBee can achieve the CTC between WiFi and ZigBee with a reliable throughput of 126Kbps in noisy environment, 16,000x faster than current state-of-the-art CTC methods.",

To track monarchs precisely and study their navigation, a monarch tracker must obtain daily localization of the butterfly as it progresses on its 3-month journey. And, the tracker must perform this task while having a weight in the tens of milligram (mg) and measuring a few millimeters (mm) in size to avoid interfering with monarch's flight. This paper proposes mSAIL, 8 \\texttimes{} 8 \\texttimes{} 2.6 mm and 62 mg embedded system for monarch migration tracking, constructed using 8 prior custom-designed ICs providing solar energy harvesting, an ultra-low power processor, light/temperature sensors, power management, and a wireless transceiver, all integrated and 3D stacked on a micro PCB with an 8 \\texttimes{} 8 mm printed antenna. The proposed system is designed to record and compress light and temperature data during the migration path while harvesting solar energy for energy autonomy, and wirelessly transmit the data at the overwintering site in Mexico, from which the daily location of the butterfly can be estimated using a deep learning-based localization algorithm. A 2-day trial experiment of mSAIL attached on a live butterfly in an outdoor botanical garden demonstrates the feasibility of individual butterfly localization and tracking.",

However, mobility has traditionally been a challenge for wireless networks due to rapid fluctuation of the signal quality. Current control systems handle this challenge by slowing down the vehicle to preserve safety. However, in this research, we demonstrate that we can robustly characterize the channel quality by mapping the multipath signals to the dynamics of the physical environment, thus controlling the trajectory of the mobile agent to a safe efficient motion path. This allows mobile systems to realize the performance benefits of wireless coordination while providing safety.",

Previous approaches either work in an intrusive manner or fail to capture the micrometer-level vibrations. In this work, we propose mmVib, a practical approach to measure micrometer-level vibrations with mmWave radar. By introducing a Multi-Signal Consolidation (MSC) model to describe the properties of the reflected signals, we exploit the inherent consistency among those signals to accurately recover the vibration characteristics. We implement a prototype of mmVib, and the experiments show that this design achieves 8.2% relative amplitude error and 0.5% relative frequency error in median. Typically, the median amplitude error is 3.4um for the 100um-amplitude vibration. Compared to two existing approaches, mmVib reduces the 80th-percentile amplitude error by 62.9% and 68.9% respectively.",

It is data plausibility, which is not addressed in any standard that comprises the WAVE framework. In particular, an attacker may forge false position values in safety beacons in order to cause unsafe response from startled receiving vehicles. The data plausibility is a longstanding issue for which various approaches based on sensor fusion, behavior analysis and communication constraints have been proposed.

In this paper, we present SensingGO, a system which encourages people to keep sensing data by integrating incentive mechanisms. The sensed data are then transmitted to our backend server. The data we collected and the source code of SensingGO are open to anyone freely. We also demonstrate the analysis of real mobile data collected from SensingGO.",

In this paper, we propose a stimulating-and-probing approach to detecting wireless spy cameras. The core idea is to actively alter the light condition of a private space to manipulate the spy camera's video scene, and then investigates the responsive variations of a packet flow to determine if it is produced by a wireless camera. Following this approach, we develop Blink and Flicker -- two practical systems for detecting wireless spy cameras. Blink is a lightweight app that can be deployed on off-the-shelf mobile devices. It asks the user to turn on/off the light of her private space, and then uses the light sensor and the wireless radio of the mobile device to identify the response of wireless cameras. Flicker is a robust and automated system that augments Blink to detect wireless cameras in both live and offline streaming modes. Flicker employs a cheap and portable circuit, which harnesses daily used LEDs to stimulate wireless cameras using human-invisible flickering. The time series of stimuli is further encoded using FEC to combat ambient light and uncontrollable packet flow variations that may degrade detection performance. Extensive experiments show that Blink and Flicker can accurately detect wireless cameras under a wide range of network and environmental conditions.",

Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), initiated as an Industry Specification Group (ISG) within ETSI, is also emerging as a low-latency and high-throughput cloud environment at the edge of network. The noticeable success that aforementioned technologies made attracts massive research interests and the interplay between them on programmable network requires an open source platform to evaluate. In this work, we present a low-latency MEC platform (LL-MEC) providing the required flexibility and programmability to meet the expected performance gain following SDN and MEC principles. We also demonstrate an use case of real-time content caching application using LL-MEC platform and OpenAirInterface LTE implementation on commodity hardware.",

With a few near-infrared (NIR) lights and photodiodes around the eye, NIR lights sequentially illuminate the eye from various directions while photodiodes sense spatial patterns of reflected light, which are used to infer pupil's position and diameter on the fly via a lightweight inference algorithm. The system also exploits characteristics of different eye movement stages and adjusts its sensing and computation accordingly for further energy savings. A prototype is built with off-the-shelf hardware components and integrated into a regular pair of glasses. Experiments with 22 participants show that the system achieves 0.8-mm mean error in tracking pupil position (2.3 mm at the 95th percentile) and 0.3-mm mean error in tracking pupil diameter (0.9 mm at the 95th percentile) at 120-Hz output frame rate, consuming 395 \u00b5W mean power supplied by two small, thin solar cells on glasses side arms.",

The key enabling technology behind PCube is a novel air-channel phase measurement technique which is able to extract phase differences of air-channels between LoRa nodes and multiple antennas of a gateway. PCube leverages the reception diversities of multiple receiving antennas of a gateway and scales the concurrent transmissions of a large number of LoRa nodes, even exceeding the number of receiving antennas at a gateway. As a phase-based parallel decoder, PCube provides a new dimension to resolve collisions and supports more concurrent transmissions by complementing time and frequency based parallel decoders. PCube is implemented and evaluated with synchronized software defined radios and off-the-shelf LoRa nodes in both indoors and outdoors. Results demonstrate that PCube can substantially outperform state-of-the-art works in terms of aggregated throughput by 4.9\\texttimes{} and the number of concurrent nodes by up to 5\\texttimes{}. More importantly, PCube scales well with the number of receiving antennas of a gateway, which is promising to break the barrier of concurrent transmissions.",

Current mobile 2FA solutions all require some form of user effort which may seriously affect the experience of mobile users, especially senior citizens or those with disability such as visually impaired users. In this paper, we propose Proximity-Proof, a secure and usable mobile 2FA system without involving user interactions. Proximity-Proof automatically transmits a user's 2FA response via inaudible OFDM-modulated acoustic signals to the login browser. We propose a novel technique to extract individual speaker and microphone fingerprints of a mobile device to defend against the powerful man-in-the-middle (MiM) attack. In addition, Proximity-Proof explores two-way acoustic ranging to thwart the co-located attack. To the best of our knowledge, Proximity-Proof is the first mobile 2FA scheme resilient to the MiM and co-located attacks. We empirically analyze that Proximity-Proof is at least as secure as existing mobile 2FA solutions while being highly usable. We also prototype Proximity-Proof and confirm its high security, usability, and efficiency through comprehensive user experiments.",

                    "abstract": "This paper presents WiSh, a solution that makes ordinary surfaces shape-aware, relaying their real-time geometry directly to a user's handheld device. WiSh achieves this using inexpensive, light-weight and battery-free RFID tags attached to these surfaces tracked from a compact single-antenna RFID reader. In doing so, WiSh enables several novel applications: shape-aware clothing that can detect a user's posture, interactive shape-aware toys or even shape-aware bridges that report their structural health.WiSh's core algorithm infers the shape of ordinary surfaces using the wireless channels of signals reflected off RFID tags received at a single-antenna RFID reader. Indeed, locating every RFID tag using a single channel measurement per-tag is challenging, given that neither their 3-D coordinates nor orientation are known a priori. WiSh presents a novel algorithm that models the geometric constraints between the coordinates of the RFID tags based on flexibility of the surface upon which they are mounted. By inferring surface curvature parameters rather than the locations of individual RFID tags, we greatly reduce the number of variables our system needs to compute. Further, WiSh overcomes a variety of system-level challenges stemming from signal multipath, stretching of fabric and modeling large surfaces. We implement WiSh on commodity RFID readers and tags attached to a variety of surfaces and demonstrate mm-accurate shape-tracking across various applications.",

                    "abstract": "Mobile and IoT scenarios increasingly involve interactive and computation intensive contextual recognition. Existing optimizations typically resort to computation offloading or simplified on-device processing. Instead, we observe that the same application is often invoked on multiple devices in close proximity. Moreover, the application instances often processsimilar contextual data that map to thesame outcome. In this paper, we proposecross-device approximate computation reuse, which minimizes redundant computation by harnessing the \"equivalence'' between different input values and reusing previously computed outputs with high confidence. We devise adaptive locality sensitive hashing (A-LSH) and homogenized k nearest neighbors (H-kNN). The former achieves scalable and constant lookup, while the latter provides high-quality reuse and tunable accuracy guarantee. We further incorporate approximate reuse as a service, called name, in the computation offloading runtime. Extensive evaluation shows that, when given 95% accuracy target, name consistently harnesses over 90% of reuse opportunities, which translates to reduced computation latency and energy consumption by a factor of 3 to 10.",

The generation of pollution maps can be performed using either sensor measurements or physical models which simulate the phenomenon of pollution dispersion. The combination of these two information sources, known as data assimilation, makes it possible to better monitor air pollution by correcting the simulations of physical models while relying on sensor measurements. The quality of data assimilation mainly depends on the number of measurements and their locations. A careful deployment of nodes is therefore necessary in order to get better pollution maps. In this ongoing work, we tackle the placement problem of pollution sensors and design a mixed integer programming model allowing to maximize the assimilation quality while ensuring the connectivity of the network. We perform some simulations on a dataset of the Lyon city, France in order to show the effectiveness of our model regarding the quality of pollution coverage.",

These resources have different levels of security and usage constraint in scenarios which have different requirements for privacy. Therefore, it is in demand for users to have fine-grained privacy protection and resources usage constraint that taking the context information into account, which is not supported by inherent access control mechanism of Android. To address these issues, we designed and implemented an enhanced context-aware adaptive access control system (EasyGuard) in Android to provide adaptive access control automatically when the specific context is detected according to the pre-configured policies. In addition, we developed an application to facilitate users that have little domain knowledge in android to configure policies reasonably. Experimental results show that users can easily protect their privacy, security and save energy of mobile devices through this system.",

RIO enables UIs to be constructed using off-the-shelf RFID readers and tags, and provides a unique approach to designing smart IoT spaces. With RIO, any surface can be turned into a touch-aware surface by simply attaching RFID tags to them. RIO also supports custom-designed RFID tags, and thus allows specially customized UIs to be easily deployed into a real-world environment. RIO is built using the technique of impedance tracking: when a human finger touches the surface of an RFID tag, the impedance of the antenna changes. This change manifests as a change in the phase of the RFID backscattered signal, and is used by RIO to track fine-grained touch movement over both off-the shelf and custom built tags. We study this impedance behavior in-depth and show how RIO is a reliable UI primitive that is robust even within a multi-tag environment. We leverage this primitive to build a prototype of RIO that can continuously locate a finger during a swipe movement to within 3 mm of its actual position. We also show how custom-design RFID tags can be built and used with RIO, and provide two example applications that demonstrate its real-world use.",

However, to create visual harmony between virtual and physical spaces, the virtual scene must be accurately illuminated with realistic lighting that matches the physical environment. To this end, we design GLEAM, a framework that provides robust illumination estimation in real-time by integrating physical light-probe estimation with current mobile AR systems. GLEAM visually observes reflective objects to compose a realistic estimation of physical lighting. Optionally, GLEAM can network multiple devices to sense illumination from different viewpoints and compose a richer estimation to enhance realism and fidelity. Using GLEAM, AR developers gain the freedom to use a wide range of materials, which is currently limited by the unrealistic appearance of materials that need accurate illumination, such as liquids, glass, and smooth metals. Our controlled environment user studies across 30 participants reveal the effectiveness of GLEAM in providing robust and adaptive illumination estimation over commercial status quo solutions, such as pre-baked directional lighting and ARKit 2.0 illumination estimation. Our benchmarks reveal the need for situation driven tradeoffs to optimize for quality factors in situations requiring freshness over quality and vice-versa. Optimizing for different quality factors in different situations, GLEAM can update scene illumination as fast as 30ms by sacrificing richness and fidelity in highly dynamic scenes, or prioritize quality by allowing an update interval as high as 400ms in scenes that require high-fidelity estimation.",

However, mainstream systems use traditional 2D face recognition technologies, which are vulnerable to various spoofing attacks. Existing systems perform liveness detection via specialized hardware, such as infrared dot projectors and dedicated cameras. Although effective, such methods do not align well with the smartphone industry's desire to maximize screen space.This paper presents a new liveness detection system, FaceRevelio, for commodity smartphones with a single front camera. It utilizes the smartphone screen to illuminate a user's face from multiple directions. The facial images captured under varying illumination enable the recovery of the face surface normals via photometric stereo, which can then be integrated into a 3D shape. We leverage the facial depth features of this 3D surface to distinguish a human face from its 2D counterpart. On top of this, we change the screen via a light passcode consisting of a combination of random light patterns to provide security against replay attacks. We evaluate FaceRevelio with 30 users trying to authenticate under various lighting conditions and with a series of 2D spoofing attacks. The results show that using a passcode of 1s, FaceRevelio achieves a mean EER of 1.4% and 0.15% against photo and video attacks, respectively.",

Breathing patterns are critical indicators of the well-being of drivers on the road. Existing studies on breathing monitoring require active user participation of wearing special sensors or relatively quiet environments during sleep, which are hardly applicable to noisy driving environments. In this work, we propose a fine-grained breathing monitoring system, BreathListener, which leverages audio devices on smartphones to estimate the fine-grained breathing waveform in driving environments. By investigating the data collected from real driving environments, we find that Energy Spectrum Density (ESD) of acoustic signals can be utilized to capture breathing procedures in driving environments. To extract breathing pattern in ESD signals, BreathListener eliminates interference from driving environments in ESD signals utilizing background subtraction and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). After that, the extracted breathing pattern is transformed into Hilbert spectrum, and we further design a deep learning architecture based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate fine-grained breathing waveform from the Hilbert spectrum of extracted breathing patterns in ESD signals. Experiments with 10 drivers in real driving environments show that BreathListener can accurately capture breathing patterns of drivers in driving environments.",

We consider both uncoupled and different coupled congestion control algorithms, compare their performance and their potential to improve throughput over single path TCP, and uncover their limitations. In contrast to a recent study that reports reduced throughput with MPTCP compared to single path TCP over 60 GHz, our results show that significant performance improvements are possible, especially in the case of uncoupled congestion control. On the other hand, performance gains with coupled congestion control are lower as these algorithms often fail to fully utilize the capacity of both paths simultaneously. We also observe a pathological case that can lead to significantly reduced throughput with MPTCP regardless of the congestion control algorithm.",

Computing the probability of a property in a network relying on complex inter-dependent routing protocols is challenging and requires determining all failure scenarios for which the property is violated. Doing so at scale and accurately goes beyond the capabilities of current network analyzers.In this paper, we introduce NetDice, the first scalable and accurate probabilistic network configuration analyzer supporting BGP, OSPF, ECMP, and static routes. Our key contribution is an inference algorithm to efficiently explore the space of failure scenarios. More specifically, given a network configuration and a property \u03c6, our algorithm automatically identifies a set of links whose failure is provably guaranteed not to change whether \u03c6 holds. By pruning these failure scenarios, NetDice manages to accurately approximate P(\u03c6). NetDice supports practical properties and expressive failure models including correlated link failures.We implement NetDice and evaluate it on realistic configurations. NetDice is practical: it can precisely verify probabilistic properties in few minutes, even in large networks.",

However, the key limitation of prior WiFi based gesture recognition systems is that they cannot recognize the gestures of multiple users performing them simultaneously. In this paper, we address this limitation and propose WiMU, a WiFi based Multi-User gesture recognition system. The key idea behind WiMU is that when it detects that some users have performed some gestures simultaneously, it first automatically determines the number of simultaneously performed gestures (Na) and then, using the training samples collected from a single user, generates virtual samples for various plausible combinations of Na gestures. The key property of these virtual samples is that the virtual samples for any given combination of gestures are identical to the real samples that would result from real users performing that combination of gestures. WiMU compares the detected sample against these virtual samples and recognizes the simultaneously performed gestures. We implemented and extensively evaluated WiMU using commodity WiFi devices. Our results show that WiMU recognizes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 simultaneously performed gestures with accuracies of 95.0, 94.6, 93.6, 92.6, and 90.9%, respectively.",

However, existing visible light localization systems require customized light hardware, which increases deployment cost and hinders near term adoption. We present LiTell, a simple and robust localization scheme that employs unmodified fluorescent lights (FLs) as location landmarks and commodity smartphones as light sensors. LiTell builds on the key observation that each FL has an inherent characteristic frequency, which can serve as a discriminative feature. It incorporates a set of sampling, signal amplification and camera optimization mechanisms, that enable a smartphone to capture the extremely weak and high frequency (&gt; 80 kHz) features. We have implemented LiTell as a real-time localization and navigation system on Android. In our experiments, LiTell demonstrates high reliability in discriminating different FLs, and great potential to achieve sub-meter granularity.",

                    "abstract": "We present GROOT, a mobile volumetric video streaming system that delivers three-dimensional data to mobile devices for a fully immersive virtual and augmented reality experience. The system design for streaming volumetric videos should be fundamentally different from conventional 2D video streaming systems. First, the amount of data required to deliver the 3D volume is considerably larger than conventional videos with frames of 2D images, even compared to high-resolution 2D or 360\u00b0 videos. Second, the 3D data representation, which encodes the surface of objects within the volume, is a sparse and unorganized data structure with varying scales, whereas a conventional video is composed of a sequence of images with the fixed-size 2D grid structure. GROOT is a streaming framework with a novel data structure that enables not only real-time transmission and decoding on mobile devices but also continuous on-demand user view adaptation. Specifically, we modify the conventional octree to introduce the independence of leaf nodes with minimal memory overhead, which enables parallel decoding of highly irregular 3D data. We also developed a suite of techniques to compress color information and filter out 3D points outside of a user's view, which efficiently minimizes the data size and decoding cost. Our extensive evaluation shows that GROOT achieves more stable but faster frame rates compared to any previous method to stream and visualize volumetric videos on mobile devices.",

We evaluate the accuracy of proposed method by comparing with conventional PDR method. As a result, we confirmed that proposed method can estimate the speed more accurately.",

However, we argue that current clean-slate learning-based techniques bring practical issues and concerns such as overhead, convergence issues, and low performance over unseen network conditions to the table. To address these issues, we take a pragmatic and evolutionary approach combining classic congestion control strategies and advanced modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques and introduce a novel hybrid congestion control for the Internet named Orca1. Through extensive experiments done over global testbeds on the Internet and various locally emulated network conditions, we demonstrate that Orca is adaptive and achieves consistent high performance in different network conditions, while it can significantly alleviate the issues and problems of its clean-slate learning-based counterparts.",

In this work, we demonstrate the power of applying predictive analytics on real-time mobility data, specifically the smart-card generated trip data of millions of public bus commuters in Singapore, to create two novel and \"live\" smart city services. The key analytical novelty in our work lies in combining two aspects of urban mobility: (a) conformity: which reflects the predictability in the aggregated flow of commuters along bus routes, and (b) regularity: which captures the repeated trip patterns of each individual commuter. We demonstrate that the fusion of these two measures of behavior can be performed at city-scale using our BuScope platform, and can be used to create two innovative smart city applications. The Last-Mile Demand Generator provides O(mins) lookahead into the number of disembarking passengers at neighborhood bus stops; it achieves over 85% accuracy in predicting such disembarkations by an ingenious combination of individual-level regularity with aggregate-level conformity. By moving driverless vehicles proactively to match this predicted demand, we can reduce wait times for disembarking passengers by over 75%. Independently, the Neighborhood Event Detector uses outlier measures of currently operating buses to detect and spatiotemporally localize dynamic urban events, as much as 1.5 hours in advance, with a localization error of ~450 meters.",

Existing systems rely on motion information, which usually fail to detect occupied rooms with stationary people. In this project, we study the possibility of converting commodity WiFi access points to occupancy sensors by exploiting multipath reflections as individual spatial sensors. The proposed method measures fine-grained distortions caused by human body on phase and amplitude of WiFi signals. Our initial results suggest that formulating WiFi parameters into angle of arrival provides a more sensitive metric to measure occupancy.",

To manage such demanding applications, a fine-grained control of end-to-end paths is imperative. End-to-end delay estimation and forecast techniques were essential traffic engineering tools even before the mobile edge computing paradigm pushed the cloud closer to the end user. In this paper, we model the path selection problem for edge traffic engineering using a risk minimization technique inspired by portfolio theory in economics, and we use machine learning to estimate the risk of a path. In particular, using real latency time series measurements, collected with and without the GENI testbed, we compare four short-horizon latency estimation techniques, commonly used by the finance community to estimate prices of volatile financial instruments. Our initial results suggest that a Bayesian Network approach may lead to good latency estimation performance and open a few research questions that we are currently exploring.",

This work optimizes indoor coverage with LAVA, a Large Array of Vanilla Amplifiers. LAVA is a standard-agnostic cooperative mesh of elements, i.e., RF devices each consisting of several switched input and output antennas connected to fixed-gain amplifiers. Each LAVA element is further equipped with rudimentary power sensing to detect nearby transmissions. The elements report power readings to the LAVA control plane, which then infers active link sessions without explicitly interacting with the endpoint transmitter or receiver. With simple on-off control of amplifiers and antenna switching, LAVA boosts passing signals via multi hop amplify-and-forward. LAVA explores a middle ground between smart surfaces and physical-layer relays. Multi-hopping over short inter-hop distances exerts more control over the end-to-end trajectory, supporting fine-grained coverage and spatial reuse. Ceiling testbed results show throughput improvements to individual Wi-Fi links by 50% on average and up to 100% at 15 dBm transmit power (193% on average, up to 8x at 0 dBm). ZigBee links see up to 17 dB power gain. For pairs of co-channel concurrent links, LAVA provides average per-link throughput improvements of 517% at 0 dBm and 80% at 15 dBm.",

LoRa links in practice, however, experience high dynamics in various environments. When the SNR falls below the threshold (e.g., in the building), a LoRa device disconnects from the network. We propose Falcon, which addresses the link dynamics by enabling data transmission for very low SNR or even disconnected LoRa links. At the heart of Falcon, we reveal that low SNR LoRa links that cannot deliver packets can still introduce interference to other LoRa transmissions. Therefore, Falcon transmits data bits on the low SNR link by selectively interfering with other LoRa transmissions. We address practical challenges in Falcon design. We propose a low-power channel activity detection method to detect other LoRa transmissions for selective interference. To interfere with the so-called interference-resilient LoRa, we accurately estimate the time and frequency offsets on LoRa packets and propose an adaptive frequency adjusting strategy to maximize the interference. We implement Falcon, all using commercial off-the-shelf LoRa devices, and extensively evaluate its performance. The results show that Falcon can provide reliable communication links for disconnected LoRa devices and achieves the SNR boundary upto 7.5 dB lower than that of standard LoRa.",

Field Operational Test (FOT) and real-world experimentation are becoming more relevant to our research community as well as to industry and regulation. Unfortunately, available commercial solutions make experimental modifications to the protocol stack time consuming or prohibit it completely. To overcome this limitation, we implemented the ETSI ITS-G5 stack on a standard embedded PC hardware and running Linux system. OpenC2X is the first complete Open Source experimentation and prototyping platform. Our system is fully interoperable to commercial solutions, yet easily extensible with new protocols and applications for vehicular networks.",

An important issue for delivery platforms is to keep updating the status of couriers especially the real-time locations, which is challenging when they are in an indoor environment. We argue the previous indoor localization techniques cannot be applied in the instant delivery scenario because they require extra deployed infrastructures and extensive labor work. In this work, we perform the couriers' indoor localization transparently in a predictive manner without extra actions of couriers by existing data from the platform including order progress reports and couriers' trajectories. Specifically, we present TransLoc to predict couriers' indoor locations by addressing two challenges including uncertain reporting behaviors and uncertain indoor mobility behaviors. Our key idea lies in two insights (i) couriers' behaviors are consistent in indoor/outdoor environments; (ii) localization, as a spatial inference problem, could be converted to a temporal inference problem. We evaluate TransLoc on 565 couriers from an instant delivery company, which improves baselines by at most 72%, and achieves a competitive result compared to a label-extensive approach. As a case study, we apply TransLoc to optimize the order dispatching strategy, which reduces the delivery time by 24%.",

In many countries, cellular networks provide the most reliable, highest bandwidth, and greatest coverage option for Internet access. While this makes smartphones a seemingly ideal platform to serve as a gateway between sensors and the cloud, we find that a device designed for multi-tenant operation and frequent human interaction becomes unreliable when tasked to continuously run a single application with no human interaction, a seemingly counter-intuitive result. Further, we find that economy phones cannot physically withstand continuous operation, resulting in a surprisingly high rate of permanent device failures in the field. If these observations hold more broadly, they would make mobile phones poorly suited to a range of sensing applications for which they have been rumored to hold great promise.",

                    "abstract": "Work offloading allows a mobile device, i.e., the client, to execute its computation-intensive code remotely on a more powerful server to improve its performance and to extend its battery life. However, the difference in instruction set architectures (ISAs) between the client and the server poses a great challenge to work offloading. Most of the existing solutions rely on language-level virtual machines to hide such differences. Therefore, they have to tie closely to the specific programming languages. Other approaches try to recompile the mobile applications to achieve the specific goal of offloading, so their applicability is limited to the availability of the source code. To overcome the above limitations, we propose to extend the capability of dynamic binary translation across clients and servers to offload the identified computation-intensive binary code regions automatically to the server at runtime. With this approach, the native binaries on the client can be offloaded to the server seamlessly without the limitations mentioned above. A prototype has been implemented using an existing retargetable dynamic binary translator. Experimental results show that our system achieves 1.93X speedup with 48.66% reduction in energy consumption for six real-world applications, and 1.62X speedup with 42.4% reduction in energy consumption for SPEC CINT2006 benchmarks.",

Through it, malware can wirelessly leak information without making network connections or emitting signals, such as sound, EMR, vibration, etc., that we can feel or are aware of. The covert channel is built on a communication method that we call NICScatter. NICScatter transmitter malware forces mobile devices, such as mobile phones, tablets or laptops, to reflect surrounding RF signals to covertly convey information. The operation is achieved by controlling the impedance of a device's wireless network interface card (NIC). Importantly, the operation requires no special privileges on current mobile OSs, which allows the malware to stealthily pass sensitive data to an attacker's nearby mobile device, which can then decode the signal and thus effectively gather the guarded data. Our experiments with different mobile devices show that the covert channel can achieve 1.6 bps and transmit as far as 2 meters. In a through-the-wall scenario, it can transmit up to 70 cm.",

In this paper, we explore whether the WiFi Fine Time Measurement (FTM) protocol, with its robust, accurate ranging capability, can complement current GPS and odometry systems to achieve lane-level positioning in urban canyons. We introduce Wi-Go, a system that simultaneously tracks vehicles and maps WiFi access point positions by coherently fusing WiFi FTMs, GPS, and vehicle odometry information together. Wi-Go also adaptively controls the FTM messaging rate from clients to prevent high bandwidth usage and congestion, while maximizing the tracking accuracy. Wi-Go achieves lane-level vehicle positioning (1.3 m median and 2.9 m 90-percentile error), an order of magnitude improvement over vehicle built-in GPS, through vehicle experiments in the urban canyons of Manhattan, New York City, as well as in suburban areas (0.8 m median and 3.2 m 90-percentile error).",

Using the model, we prove that if the traffic pattern is textit{interference-free}, there exists a unique optimal design that both minimizes maximum flow completion time and yields maximal system-wide throughput. We show that interference-free patterns correspond to the important set of patterns that display data locality properties and use these theoretical insights to study three widely used interconnects---fat-trees, folded-Clos and dragonfly topologies. We derive equations that describe the optimal design for each interconnect as a function of the traffic pattern. Our model predicts, for example, that a 3-level folded-Clos interconnect with radix 24 that routes 10% of the traffic through the spine links can reduce the number of switches and cabling at the core layer by 25% without any performance penalty. We present experiments using production TCP/IP code to empirically validate the results and provide tables for network designers to identify optimal designs as a function of the size of the interconnect and traffic pattern.",

Network emulation enables to test the practical software of the system without building a physical network. Many existing network emulators are built by using a virtual Ethernet device named TUN/TAP device for enabling a network simulator to capture Ethernet frames. However, the network emulation with the TUN/TAP device cannot emulate the operation of the WLAN protocols such as ETSI DCC, which dynamically changes transmission power and interval based on receive signal strength indication (RSSI), because the TUN/TAP device cannot capture IEEE 802.11 frames and control parameters such as transmission power, RSSI. In previous work, we developed a wireless network tap device (wtap80211) and proposed a vehicular network emulator using wtap80211. In the demonstration, we will demonstrate the capability of our emulator using its prototype.",

Virtualizing the mobile network in a flexible way is of paramount importance for a cost-effective realization of this vision. While virtualization has been extensively studied in the case of the mobile core, virtualizing the radio access network (RAN) is still at its infancy. In this paper, we present Orion, a novel RAN slicing system that enables the dynamic on-the-fly virtualization of base stations, the flexible customization of slices to meet their respective service needs and which can be used in an end-to-end network slicing setting. Orion guarantees the functional and performance isolation of slices, while allowing for the efficient use of RAN resources among them. We present a concrete prototype implementation of Orion for LTE, with experimental results, considering alternative RAN slicing approaches, indicating its efficiency and highlighting its isolation capabilities. We also present an extension to Orion for accommodating the needs of OTT providers.",

Yet, it is challenging to protect privacy while still preserving desired VSA features, i.e., effective analytics, forensic support, resource efficiency, and real-time execution. In this paper, we present a VSA privacy enhancement system (PECAM), which addresses the above challenge with no change in the VSA back-end. PECAM leverages a novel Generative Adversarial Network to perform the privacy-enhanced securely-reversible video transformation. PECAM also incorporates a couple of system optimizations into its VSA workflow to reduce network bandwidth usage and enable real-time processing on cameras. We implement our PECAM prototype on commodity hardware and evaluate its performance via both security study and extensive experiments. Results demonstrate that PECAM can effectively enhance the visual privacy of VSA in the presence of an adversary, and its transformed videos, when taken as input for various VSA back-end tasks, maintain a 96% accuracy of corresponding original videos. Additionally, it performs 12.3\\texttimes{} and 1.8\\texttimes{} better than baseline methods in terms of the computing cost and network bandwidth usage, respectively.",

In this paper, we present a nearly two-year measurement study towards understanding various key aspects of today's MVNO ecosystem, including its architecture, performance, economics, customers, and the complex interplay with the base carrier. Our study focuses on a large commercial MVNO with reviseabout 1 million customers, operating atop a nation-wide base carrier. Our measurements clarify several key concerns raised by MVNO customers, such as inaccurate billing and potential performance discrimination with the base carrier. We also leverage big data analytics and machine learning to optimize an MVNO's key businesses such as data plan reselling and customer churn mitigation. Our proposed techniques can help achieve %will lead to higher revenues and improved services for commercial MVNOs.",

                    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies has led to an emerging need to make them smarter. A variety of applications now run simultaneously on an ARM-based processor. For example, devices on the edge of the Internet are provided with higher horsepower to be entrusted with storing, processing and analyzing data collected from IoT devices. This significantly improves efficiency and reduces the amount of data that needs to be transported to the cloud for data processing, analysis and storage. However, commodity OSes are prone to compromise. Once they are exploited, attackers can access the data on these devices. Since the data stored and processed on the devices can be sensitive, left untackled, this is particularly disconcerting. In this paper, we propose a new system, TrustShadow that shields legacy applications from untrusted OSes. TrustShadow takes advantage of ARM TrustZone technology and partitions resources into the secure and normal worlds. In the secure world, TrustShadow constructs a trusted execution environment for security-critical applications. This trusted environment is maintained by a lightweight runtime system that coordinates the communication between applications and the ordinary OS running in the normal world. The runtime system does not provide system services itself. Rather, it forwards requests for system services to the ordinary OS, and verifies the correctness of the responses. To demonstrate the efficiency of this design, we prototyped TrustShadow on a real chip board with ARM TrustZone support, and evaluated its performance using both microbenchmarks and real-world applications. We showed TrustShadow introduces only negligible overhead to real-world applications.",

Existing solutions adopting physical covert channels have limitations in receiver distinction, additional hardware, conditional placement, or physical contact. Our system, Deaf-Aid, utilizes the stealthy speaker-to-gyroscope channel to build robust protocol-independent communication with automatic receiver identification. Deaf-Aid exploits ultrasonic signals at a frequency corresponding to the target receiver, forcing the gyroscope inside to resonate, so as to convey information. We probe the relationship among axes in a gyroscope to surmount frequency offset ingeniously and support multi-channel communication. Meanwhile, Deaf-Aid identifies the receivers automatically via device fingerprints constituted by the diversity of resonant frequency ranges. Furthermore, we entitle Deaf-Aid the capability of mobile communication which is an essential demand for IoT devices. We address the challenge of accurate signals recovery from motion interference. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Deaf-Aid yields 47bps with BER lower than 1% under motion interference. To our best knowledge, Deaf-Aid is the first work to enable stealthy mobile IoT communication on the basis of inertial motion sensors.",

Consider a BCI command to be a word consisting of a sequence of characters. Each character is a thought or action that can be reliably detected through brain waves. For this work, we specifically consider eye-blinks as the user action of interest. Eye-blinks are an interesting modality for BCI commands because of their easy detectability and naturalness (and hence covertness). It turns out that there is an interesting trade-off between the complexity of characters and the length of words. In this work, we perform a user-study to answer a simple, but important, question pertaining to eye-blinks based BCI command design: do users prefer shorter characters (and hence longer words) or shorter words (and hence longer characters) when performing commands?. We present a simple eye-blink language consisting of words and characters and use real user-experiments to study the aforementioned trade-off.",

                    "abstract": "Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) has emerged as a powerful method to extend packet-processing functionality in the Linux operating system. BPF allows users to write code in high-level languages (like C or Rust) and execute them at specific hooks in the kernel, such as the network device driver. To ensure safe execution of a user-developed BPF program in kernel context, Linux uses an in-kernel static checker. The checker allows a program to execute only if it can prove that the program is crash-free, always accesses memory within safe bounds, and avoids leaking kernel data.BPF programming is not easy. One, even modest-sized BPF programs are deemed too large to analyze and rejected by the kernel checker. Two, the kernel checker may incorrectly determine that a BPF program exhibits unsafe behaviors. Three, even small performance optimizations to BPF code (e.g., 5% gains) must be meticulously hand-crafted by expert developers. Traditional optimizing compilers for BPF are often inadequate since the kernel checker's safety constraints are incompatible with rule-based optimizations.We present K2, a program-synthesis-based compiler that automatically optimizes BPF bytecode with formal correctness and safety guarantees. K2 produces code with 6--26% reduced size, 1.36%--55.03% lower average packet-processing latency, and 0--4.75% higher throughput (packets per second per core) relative to the best clang-compiled program, across benchmarks drawn from Cilium, Facebook, and the Linux kernel. K2 incorporates several domain-specific techniques to make synthesis practical by accelerating equivalence-checking of BPF programs by 6 orders of magnitude.",

                    "abstract": "As autonomous vehicles loom as reality, and the vehicle communication starts to be enforced by law from 2020, protecting vulnerable road users (VRUs) using vehicle communication is receiving attention. The current vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) communication as stipulated by the standards such as SAE J2735 implies that it is the vehicles that take the responsibility for VRU protection. User devices are essentially beacons that transmit Personal Safety Messages (PSMs), and upon receiving PSMs, the drivers (or autonomous vehicles) take necessary measures to protect them. We, however, believe that the road users also need information about nearby vehicles to protect themselves from dangerous situations. Using other technologies than the standard Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC), there have been existing works for VRU protection. They use Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi Direct as replacements of DSRC. An automaker tested DSRC for VRU protection, but no technical detail has been presented. An important issue with the existing VRU protection proposals is that they are fraught with false alarms, which lowers the utility of the whole idea. Although one can come up with a highly precise collision prediction model, any such model will generate a huge number of false alarms, especially in urban environments. For example, if a pedestrian walks along a sidewalk well protected from the driveway, all passing vehicles will generate an alert to the pedestrian and vice versa. So our approach instead provides intuitive visual cues to the smartphone user looking at the screen, so that they can use their discretion to determine the level of danger for themselves.",

Unlike most existing drone testbeds that focus on low-level mechanical control, FlyZone offers a high-level API and features geared towards experimenting with application-level functionality. These include the emulation of environment influences, such as wind, and the automatic monitoring of developer-provided safety constraints, for example, to mimic obstacles. We conceive novel solutions to achieve this functionality, including a hardware/software architecture that maximizes decoupling from the main application and a custom visual localization technique expressly designed for testbed operation. We deploy two instances of FlyZone and study performance and effectiveness. We demonstrate that we realistically emulate the environment influence with a positioning error bound by the size of the smallest drone we test, that our localization technique provides a root mean square error of 9.2cm, and that detection of violations to safety constraints happens with a 50ms worst-case latency. We also report on how FlyZone supported developing three real-world drone applications, and discuss a user study demonstrating the benefits of FlyZone compared to drone simulators.",

Harnessing available information on geographical position of vehicles and spectrum resources utilization, eNodeBs are capable of allotting the same set of sidelink resources to different vehicles distributed among several communications clusters. Within a communications cluster, it is crucial to prevent time-domain allocation conflicts since vehicles cannot transmit and receive simultaneously, i.e., they must transmit in orthogonal time resources. In this research, we present a solution based on a bipartite graph, where vehicles and spectrum resources are represented by vertices whereas the edges represent the achievable rate in each resource based on the SINR that each vehicle perceives. The aforementioned time orthogonality constraint can be approached by aggregating conflicting vertices into macro-vertices which, in addition, reduces the search complexity. We show mathematically and through simulations that the proposed approach yields an optimal solution. In addition, we provide simulations showing that the proposed method outperforms other competing approaches, specially in scenarios with high vehicular density.",

However, these devices emit visible light through screens where long-term use can lead to significant screen exposure, further influencing users' health. Conventional methods on screen exposure detection (textite.g., photo logger) are usually privacy-invasive and expensive, further, require ideal light conditions, which are unattainable in real practice. Considering the light intensity and spectrum vary among different light sources, an effective screen spectrum estimation can provide vital information about screen exposure. To this end, we first investigate the characteristics of the junction between p-type and n-type semiconductor (i.e., PN junction) to sense the spectrum under various conditions. Empirically, we design and implement, textsfSpecEye, an end-to-end, low cost, wearable, and privacy-preserving screen exposure detection system with a mobile application. For validating the performance of our system, we conduct comprehensive experiments with $54$ commodity digital screens, at $43$ distinct locations, with results showing a base accuracy of $99$%, and an equal error rate (EER) approaching $0.80$% under the controlled lab setup. Moreover, we assess the reliability, robustness, and performance variation of textsfSpecEye under various real-world circumstances to observe a stable accuracy of $95$%. Our real-world study indicates textsfSpecEye is a promising system for screen exposure detection in everyday life.",

Recent studies tend to combine (Network Function Virtualization) NFV with MEC and deploy (Virtualized Network Functions) VNFs on MEC servers to achieve fast access to the edge user equipment (UE). However, to guarantee the QoS requirements of mobile users, it is necessary to migrate VNFs to an advisable edge server when users move across Base Stations (BS). How to choose the target BS for VNFs migration? How to select the path for VNF data migration? How to ensure the QoS of user services during the migration process? To solve these issues, we study the seamless VNFs migration problem in mobile edge networks and formulate it as an ILP model, which aims to minimize the migration delay and cost. Then we propose a migration algorithm based on Dijkstra (MBD) to obtain the migration destination BS and migration paths. We implement the mathematical model in Gurobi and design a Greedy algorithm to compare the performance with the MBD algorithm. The experiment results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.",

Although active attempts have been made to reduce energy consumption, the advent of energy-aware scheduling (EAS) integrated in the recent devices suggests the possibility of a new approach for optimizing energy use by browsers. Our preliminary analysis showed that the existing EAS-enabled system is overly optimized for performance, leading to energy inefficiencies while a web browser is running. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of web browsers, and investigate the cause of energy inefficiency in EAS-enabled mobile devices. We then propose a system, called WebTune, to improve the energy efficiency of mobile browsers. Exploiting the reinforcement learning technique, WebTune learns the optimal execution speed of the web browser's processes, and adjusts the speed at runtime, thus saving energy and ensuring the quality of service (QoS). WebTune is implemented on the latest Android-based smartphones, and evaluated with Alexa's top 200 websites. The experimental results show that WebTune reduced the device-level energy consumption of the Google Pixel 2 XL and Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus smartphones by 18.7-22.0% and 13.7-16.1%, respectively, without degrading the QoS.",

                    "abstract": "Modern network infrastructure has evolved into a complex organism to satisfy the performance and availability requirements for the billions of users. Frequent releases such as code upgrades, bug fixes and security updates have become a norm. Millions of globally distributed infrastructure components including servers and load-balancers are restarted frequently from multiple times per-day to per-week. However, every release brings possibilities of disruptions as it can result in reduced cluster capacity, disturb intricate interaction of the components operating at large scales and disrupt the end-users by terminating their connections. The challenge is further complicated by the scale and heterogeneity of supported services and protocols.In this paper, we leverage different components of the end-to-end networking infrastructure to prevent or mask any disruptions in face of releases. Zero Downtime Release is a collection of mechanisms used at Facebook to shield the end-users from any disruptions, preserve the cluster capacity and robustness of the infrastructure when updates are released globally. Our evaluation shows that these mechanisms prevent any significant cluster capacity degradation when a considerable number of productions servers and proxies are restarted and minimizes the disruption for different services (notably TCP, HTTP and publish/subscribe).",

One area with little progress in this direction is cellular core networks. A cellular core network manages the state of cellular clients; it is essentially a large distributed state machine with very different virtualization challenges compared to typical cloud services. In this paper we present a novel cellular core network architecture, called ECHO, particularly suited to public cloud deployments, where the availability guarantees might be an order of magnitude worse compared to existing (redundant) hardware platforms. We present the design and implementation of our approach and evaluate its functionality on a public cloud platform. Analysis shows ECHO promises higher availability than existing telco solutions.",

The core opportunity arises from the fact that wireless signals experience distinct slow-down and attenuation when passing through a liquid, manifesting in the phase, strength, and propagation delay of the outgoing signal. While this intuition is simple, building a robust system entails numerous challenges, including (1) pico-second scale time of flight estimation, (2) coping with integer ambiguity due to phase wraps, (3) pollution from hardware noise and multipath, and (4) compensating for the liquid-container's impact on the measurements. We address these challenges through multiple stages of signal processing without relying on any feature extraction or machine learning. Instead, we model the behavior of radio signals inside liquids (using principles of physics), and estimate the liquid's permittivity, which in turn identifies the liquid. Experiments across 33 different liquids (spread over the whole permittivity spectrum) show median permittivity error of 9%. This implies that coke can be discriminated from diet coke or pepsi, whole milk from 2% milk, and distilled water from saline water. Our end system, LiquID, is cheap, non-invasive, and amenable to real-world applications.",

Specifically, we introduce Surface MIMO, a technique that enables MIMO communication between small devices via surfaces coated with conductive paint or covered with conductive cloth. These surfaces act as an additional spatial path that enables MIMO capabilities without increasing the physical size of the devices themselves. We provide an extensive characterization of these surfaces that reveal their effect on the propagation of EM waves. Our evaluation shows that we can enable additional spatial streams using the conductive surface and achieve average throughput gains of 2.6-3x for small devices. Finally, we also leverage the wideband characteristics of these conductive surfaces to demonstrate the first Gbps surface communication system that can directly transfer bits through the surface at up to 1.3Gbps.",

We have reverse engineered the protocol and explain its frame format and operation in our MobiCom '18 paper \"One Billion Apples' Secret Sauce: Recipe of the Apple Wireless Direct Link Ad hoc Protocol.\" AWDL builds on the IEEE 802.11 standard and implements election, synchronization, and channel hopping mechanisms on top of it. Furthermore, AWDL features an IPv6-based data path which enables direct communication. To validate our own work, we implement a working prototype of AWDL on Linux-based systems. Our implementation is written in C, runs in userspace, and makes use of Linux's Netlink API for interactions with the system's networking stack and the pcap library for frame injection and reception. In our demonstrator, we show how our Linux system synchronizes to an existing AWDL cluster or takes over the master role itself. Furthermore, it can receive data frames from and send them to a MacBook or iPhone via AWDL. We demonstrate the data exchange via ICMPv6 echo request and replies as well as sending and receiving data over a TCP connection.",

                    "abstract": "Public spaces are equipped with 'public actuators', e.g., HVAC, lighting fixtures, speakers, or streaming TV channels to ensure their visitors' comfort. However, many public actuators rarely allow the visitors to adjust their operation, limiting their utility and fairness across the visitors. Also, the social bar is often too high to speak up one's preference and attempt to change an actuator's operation. Social control and use of IoT devices is an underexplored new direction of research even with its huge potential and implication, but comes with high complexity and scale. This paper proposes a novel architecture, namely, Social Control-and-Use Architecture for IoT Devices, which provides a systematic view and an effective tool to handle the complication and intricacy in system design. It also proposes Hivemind, a first-of-a-kind system developed, upon the architecture, for sharing IoT-enabled actuators in a public space. It transforms an exclusively-controlled actuator in a public space into a true public actuator, supporting visitors to instantly participate in the democratic collective control. Also, a myriad of off-the-shelf actuators are easily incorporated without modification to their implementation. The field deployment of Hivemind shows its comprehensive service coverage as well as the users' approval on the democratic collective control of public actuators.",

VLC is considered as a secure wireless communication scheme because VLC signals can be easily constrained within physical boundaries. In this paper, for the first time, we show that VLC is not as secure as people thought: VLC can be sniffed through walls! The key principle behind this is that in VLC transmissions, a VLC transmitter not only emits visible light signals but also leaks out 'side channel RF signals'. The leaked RF signals can be sniffed by a receiver to decode the VLC transmissions even the receiver is blocked (e.g., by walls) from the VLC transmitter. In this work, we establish a theoretical model to quantify the amplitude of the leaked RF signal and verify the model with comprehensive experiments. We design and implement a VLC sniffing system including receiver coil design, signal processing and frame decoding, spanning across hardware and software. Field studies show that with a cheap receiver design, our system can simultaneously sniff transmissions from multiple VLC transmitters 6.4 meters away with a 14 cm concrete wall in between, where the distance exceeds the communication range of most state-of-the-art VLC systems. By simply twining a wired earphone on the arm, we can sniff the VLC transmission 1.9 meters away.",

This introduces novel opportunities for battery-free and ubiquitous sensing. We take advantage of backscatter communication to enable networked utensils. We imagine a scenario where such utensils can provide essential information about the state of the food or the beverage; for instance, the temperature or the quality of food contained in the utensils. We propose flex sensors, to achieve this capability, by augmenting utensils with flexible and inexpensive battery-free sensors that can communicate wirelessly. We demonstrate our efforts by designing a smart cup that tracks the temperature of the beverage.",

Virtualizing the mobile network components in a flexible and cost-effective way is therefore of paramount importance. In this work, we highlight the capabilities of Orion, a novel RAN slicing architecture that enables the dynamic virtualization of base stations and flexible customization of slices to meet their respective service needs. Our demonstration of Orion's capabilities is based on a prototype implementation employing a modified version of the OpenAirInterface software LTE platform. Using this prototype, we demonstrate the functional and performance isolation, and the efficient sharing of radio hardware and spectrum that can be achieved among Orion RAN slices. Moreover, we show how Orion can be used in an end-to-end network slicing setting and demonstrate the effects of the slices' configuration and placement of virtual functions in the overall quality of the deployed services.",

Despite all its capabilities, the introduction of various architectural entities of SDN poses many security threats and potential target. Especially, Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) is a rapidly growing attack that poses a tremendous threat to both control plane and forwarding plane of SDN. Asthe control layer is vulnerable to DDoS attack, the goal of this paper is to provide a defense system which is based on Learning Automata (LA) concepts. It is a self-operating mechanism that responds to a sequence of actions in a certain way to achieve a specific goal. The simulation results show that this scheme effectively reduces the TCP connection setup delay due to DDoS attack.",

For ease of deployment of such networks, a wireless backhaul network is highly desired. Since RF-based technologies are unlikely to provide the desired multi-gigabit data rates, we motivate and explore use of free space optics (FSO) for picocell backhaul. In particular, we present a novel network architecture based on steerable links and sufficiently many robust short-range links, to help circumvent the key challenge of outdoor effects in reliable operation of outdoor FSO links. Our architecture is motivated by the fact that, due to the high density of picocells, many short-range links will occur naturally in a picocell backhaul. Moreover, use of steerable FSO links facilitates networks with sufficient redundancy while using only a small number of interfaces per node. We address the key problems that arise in the context of such a backhaul architecture, viz., an FSO link design with desired characteristics, and related network design and management problems. We develop and evaluate a robust 100m FSO link prototype, and simulate the proposed architecture in many metro US cities while show its viability via evaluation of key performance metrics.",

Proxies that execute Web page JavaScript (JS) and push objects needed by the client can reduce latency. However, a key concern is the scalability of the proxy which must execute JS for many concurrent users. In this paper, we propose to scale the proxies, focusing on a design where the proxy's execution is solely to push the needed objects and the client completely executes the page as normal. Such redundant execution is a simple, yet effective approach to cutting network latencies, which dominate page load delays in cellular settings. We develop whittling, a technique to identify and execute in the proxy only the JS code necessary to identify and push the objects required for the client page load, while skipping other code. Whittling is closely related to program slicing, but with the important distinction that it is acceptable to approximate the program slice in the proxy given the client's complete execution. Experiments with top Alexa Web pages show NutShell can sustain, on average, 27% more user requests per second than a proxy performing fully redundant execution, while preserving, and sometimes enhancing, the latency benefits.",

But the need for specialized LED fixtures, and the associated retrofitting cost, has been hindering the adoption of VLP. In this paper, we forgo this approach and design iLAMP to enable reliable, high-precision VLP using conventional LEDs and fluorescent lamps inside today's buildings. Our key observation is that these lamps intrinsically possess hidden visual features, which are imperceptible to human eyes, but can be extracted by capturing and processing the lamps' images using a computational imaging framework. Simply using commodity smartphones' front cameras, our approach can identify lamps within a building with close to 100% accuracy. Furthermore, we develop a geometrical model which combines the camera image with gyroscope/accelerometer output, to estimate a smartphone's 3D location and heading direction relative to each lamp landmark. Our field tests demonstrate a mean localization (heading) precision of 3 cm (2.6 degree) and 90-percentile 3.5 cm (2.8 degree), even if a single lamp falls in the camera's field of view.",

Osprey makes use of commodity automotive, mmWave RADAR, places it in the tire well of automobiles to image the tire and then measures the tire wear. Osprey measures accurate tire wear continuously while being resilient to road debris and without embedding any electronics in tires. Osprey achieves this by building a super resolution algorithm based on Inverse Synthetic Aperture RADAR imaging and by embedding thin metallic strips along coded patterns in the grooves to combat debris. Here, we implement Osprey on a tire rotation rig and demonstrate the ability to measure tire wear (with and without debris) accurately and detect potentially harmful foreign objects.",

VSkin utilizes both the structure-borne sounds, i.e., sounds propagating through the structure of the device, and the air-borne sounds, i.e., sounds propagating through the air, to sense finger tapping and movements. By measuring both the amplitude and the phase of each path of sound signals, VSkin detects tapping events with an accuracy of 99.65% and captures finger movements with an accuracy of 3.59mm.",

Secret handshakes enable mutual authentication, with the property that the parties learn nothing about each other unless they have been both issued credentials by a group administrator. This property provides strong privacy guarantees that enable interesting applications. One of them is proximity-based discovery for private communities. We introduce MASHaBLE, a mobile application that enables participants to discover and interact with nearby users if and only if they belong to the same secret community. We use direct peer-to-peer communication over Bluetooth LE, rather than relying on a central server. We discuss the specifics of implementing secret handshakes over Bluetooth LE and present our prototype implementation.",

As we think about ML solving complex tasks, sometimes at super-human levels, it is easy to forget that there is no machine learning without humans in the loop. Humans define tasks and metrics, develop and program algorithms, collect and label data, debug and optimize systems, and are (usually) ultimately the users of the ML-based applications we are developing. In this talk, we will cover 4 human-centered perspectives in the ML development process, along with methods and systems, to empower humans to maximize the ultimate impact of their ML-based applications. In particular, we will cover: 1. Developer tools for ML that allow a wider range of people to create intelligent applications?, focusing on mobile devices. 2. Learning to optimize the performance and power of ML models on a wide range of hardware backends and mobile devices. 3. Closing the gap between the loss function we optimize in ML and the product metrics we really want to optimize. 4. Helping humans understand why ML models make each prediction, when these models will break, and how to improve them.",

To support this growing demand, the concept of nested-NEMO has evolved over the past few years. However, due to the inherent architecture of nested-NEMO, it is inefficient in terms of hand-off delay and throughput which hinder it to deploy as a highly scalable network. In this paper, we address the scalability issue of nested-NEMO and propose a hierarchical node attachment process for the mobile devices. The performance of the proposed mechanism has been evaluated where we computed the hand-off delay and throughput and observed that the proposed mechanism supports a considerable degree of scalability as compared to the existing nested network mobility architecture.",

                    "abstract": "By omitting external lighting, OLED display significantly reduces the power draw compared to its predecessor LCD and has gained wide adoption in modern smartphones. The real potential of OLED in saving phone battery drain lies in exploiting app UI color design, i.e., how to design app UI to use pixel colors that result in low OLED display power draw. In this paper, we design and implement an accurate per-frame OLED display power profiler, PFOP, that helps developers to gain insight into the impact of different app UI design on its OLED power draw, and an enhanced Android Battery that helps phone users to understand and manage phone display energy drain, for example, from different app and display configurations such as dark mode and screen brightness. A major challenge in designing both tools is to develop an accurate and robust OLED display power model. We experimentally show that linear-regression-based OLED power models developed in the past decade cannot capture the unique behavior of OLED display hardware in modern smartphones which have a large color space and propose a new piecewise power model that achieves much better modeling accuracy than the prior-art by applying linear regression in each small regions of the vast color space. Using the two tools, we performed to our knowledge the first power saving measurement of the emerging dark mode for a set of popular Google Android apps.",

Typically, these applications need predefined features and are only applicable to predefined activities. In this work, we address the issue of deep understanding of arbitrary activities and semantic searching of any activity over massive mobile sensing data. The challenges stem from the rich dynamics and the wide-spectrum of activities that a human being could perform. We propose a hierarchical activity representation, extract common bases of motion data in an unsupervised manner by leveraging the power of deep neural networks, and propose a universal multi-resolution representation for all activities without prior knowledge. Based on this representation, we design an innovative system Lasagna to manage and search motion data semantically. We implement a prototype system and our comprehensive evaluations show that our system can achieve highly accurate activity classification (with precision 98.9%) and search (with recall almost 100% and precision about 90%) over a diverse set of activities.",

How to authenticate users operating on these devices is thus an important problem. IoT devices usually lack conventional user interfaces, such as keyboards and mice, which makes traditional authentication methods inapplicable. We present a virtual sensing technique that allows IoT devices to virtually sense user 'petting' (in the form of some very simple touches for about 2 seconds) on the devices. Based on this technique, we build a secure and intuitive authentication method that authenticates device users by comparing the petting operations sensed by devices and those captured by the user wristband. The authentication method is highly secure as physical operations are required, rather than based on proximity. It is also intuitive, adopting very simple authentication operations, e.g., clicking buttons, twisting rotary knobs, and swiping touchscreens. Unlike the state-of-the-art methods, our method does not require any hardware modifications of devices, and thus can be applied to commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices. We build prototypes and evaluate them comprehensively, demonstrating their high effectiveness, security, usability, and efficiency.",

Existing systems address the issue with ultra-low-power designs and energy scavenging, which inevitably limit functionality. To unlock the full potential of ubiquitous computing and connectivity, our solution uses capacitive power transfer (CPT) to provide battery-like wireless power delivery, henceforth referred to as \"Capttery\". Capttery presents the first room-level (~5 m) CPT system, which delivers continuous milliwatt-level wireless power to multiple IoT devices concurrently. Unlike conventional one-to-one CPT systems that target kilowatt power in a controlled and potentially hazardous setup, Capttery is designed to be human-safe and invariant in a practical and dynamic environment. Our evaluation shows that Capttery can power end-to-end IoT applications across a typical room, where new receivers can be easily added in a plug-and-play manner.",

We use a model-driven approach to optimize the waveform, so as to ensure protection against the (uncontrollable) cameras and potential image-processing based attacks. We have also designed mechanisms to unblock authorized cameras and enable graceful degradation under strong ambient light interference. This demo will show our prototype implementation, with simple on-site experiments that demonstrate how LiShield effectively destroys unauthorized photo capturing.",

Systems that use different frequency bands for uplink and downlink communication often need feedback between devices to exchange band specific channel information. The current state-of-the-art approach proposes a way to predict the channel in the downlink based on that of the observed uplink by identifying variables underlying the uplink channel. In this paper we present a solution that greatly reduces the complexity of this task, and is even applicable for single antenna devices. Our approach uses a neural network trained on a standard channel model to generate coarse estimates for the variables underlying the channel. We then use a simple and efficient single antenna optimization framework to get more accurate variable estimates, which can be used for downlink channel prediction. We implement our approach on software defined radios and compare it to the state-of-the-art through experiments and simulations. Results show that our approach reduces the time complexity by at least an order of magnitude (10x), while maintaining similar prediction quality.",

                    "abstract": "This paper presents WiPose, the first 3D human pose construction framework using commercial WiFi devices. From the pervasive WiFi signals, WiPose can reconstruct 3D skeletons composed of the joints on both limbs and torso of the human body. By overcoming the technical challenges faced by traditional camera-based human perception solutions, such as lighting and occlusion, the proposed WiFi human sensing technique demonstrates the potential to enable a new generation of applications such as health care, assisted living, gaming, and virtual reality. WiPose is based on a novel deep learning model that addresses a series of technical challenges. First, WiPose can encode the prior knowledge of human skeleton into the posture construction process to ensure the estimated joints satisfy the skeletal structure of the human body. Second, to achieve cross environment generalization, WiPose takes as input a 3D velocity profile which can capture the movements of the whole 3D space, and thus separate posture-specific features from the static objects in the ambient environment. Finally, WiPose employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) and a smooth loss to enforce smooth movements of the generated skeletons. Our evaluation results on a real-world WiFi sensing testbed with distributed antennas show that WiPose can localize each joint on the human skeleton with an average error of 2.83cm, achieving a 35% improvement in accuracy over the state-of-the-art posture construction model designed for dedicated radar sensors.",

                    "abstract": "Frequent blood pressure (BP) assessment is key to the diagnosis and treatment of many severe diseases, such as heart failure, kidney failure, hypertension, and hemodialysis. Current \"gold-standard'' BP measurement techniques require the complete blockage of blood flow, which causes discomfort and disruption to normal activity when the assessment is done repetitively and frequently. Unfortunately, patients with hypertension or hemodialysis often have to get their BP measured every 15 minutes for a duration of 4-5 hours or more. The discomfort of wearing a cumbersome and limited mobility device affects their normal activities. In this work, we propose a device called eBP to measure BP from inside the user's ear aiming to minimize the measurement's impact on users' normal activities while maximizing its comfort level. eBP has 3 key components: (1) a light-based pulse sensor attached on an inflatable pipe that goes inside the ear, (2) a digital air pump with a fine controller, and (3) a BP estimation algorithm. In contrast to existing devices, eBP introduces a novel technique that eliminates the need to block the blood flow inside the ear, which alleviates the user's discomfort. We prototyped eBP custom hardware and software and evaluated the system through a comparative study on 35 subjects. The study shows that eBP obtains the average error of 1.8 mmHg and -3.1 mmHg and a standard deviation error of 7.2 mmHg and 7.9 mmHg for systolic (high-pressure value) and diastolic (low-pressure value), respectively. These errors are around the acceptable margins regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows mean errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg.",

However, mmWave links are notorious for low reliability since they suffer from frequent outages due to blockage and user mobility. We build mmReliable, a reliable mmWave system that implements multi-beamforming and user tracking to handle environmental vulnerabilities. It creates constructive multi-beam patterns and optimizes their angle, phase, and amplitude to maximize the signal strength at the receiver. Multi-beam links are reliable since they are resilient to occasional blockages of few constituent beams compared to a single-beam system. We implement mmReliable on a 28 GHz testbed with 400 MHz bandwidth, and a 64 element phased array supporting 5G NR waveforms. Rigorous indoor and outdoor experiments demonstrate that mmReliable achieves close to 100% reliability providing 2.3x improvement in the throughput-reliability product than single-beam systems.",

State-of-the-art QA models are deep learning behemoths designed for the cloud which run extremely slow and require more memory than available on phones. We present DeQA, a suite of latency- and memory- optimizations that adapts existing QA systems to run completely locally on mobile phones. Specifically, we design two latency optimizations that (1) stops processing documents if further processing cannot improve answer quality, and (2) identifies computation that does not depend on the question and moves it offline. These optimizations do not depend on the QA model internals and can be applied to several existing QA models. DeQA also implements a set of memory optimizations by (i) loading partial indexes in memory, (ii) working with smaller units of data, and (iii) replacing in-memory lookups with a key-value database. We use DeQA to port three state-of-the-art QA systems to the mobile device and evaluate over three datasets. The first is a large scale SQuAD dataset defined over Wikipedia collection. We also create two on-device QA datasets, one over a publicly available email data collection and the other using a cross-app data collection we obtain from two users. Our evaluations show that DeQA can run QA models with only a few hundred MBs of memory and provides at least 13x speedup on average on the mobile phone across all three datasets.% with less than a 1% drop in accuracy.",

Previous research has shown that millimeter level accuracy is capable using an off-the-shelf smartphone. This work demonstrates that such valuable resources in smartphones are readily available for developing consumer applications. We develop a smartphone application called HearHere that utilizes geometric features of sound to categorize a tapping sound within a grid. The geometric features are based on the Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) of the sound between two microphones. By using this classification, any off the shelf phone with stereo recording capability can be made into a music producing device. The application consists of three major components: system calibration, data collection, and audio localization engine based on TDoA. We demonstrate that we can accurately map the tapping sound six region on various solid surface and turn it into a MIDI controller with six different types of instruments.",

By combining passive acoustic microstructures with microphones, we envision achieving the same functionalities as microphone and speaker arrays with less power consumption and in a smaller form factor. Our design uses a 3D-printed metamaterial structure over a microphone to introduce a carefully designed spatial signature to the recorded signal.

In this paper, we show that LiFi and RF backscatter are complementary and have unexplored interactions. We introduce PassiveLiFi, a battery-free system that uses LiFi to transmit RF backscatter at a meagre power budget. We address several challenges on the system design in the LiFi transmitter, the tag and the RF receiver. We design the first LiFi transmitter that implements a chirp spread spectrum (CSS) using the visible light spectrum. We use a small bank of solar cells for communication and harvesting and reconfigure them based on the amount of harvested energy and desired data rate. We further alleviate the low responsiveness of solar cells with a new low-power receiver design in the tag. Experimental results with an RF carrier of 17 dBm show that we can generate RF backscatter with a range of 80.3 meters/\u03bcW consumed in the tag, which is almost double with respect to prior work.",

However, the high cost of commercial soil moisture sensors and the inaccuracy of sub-1000 dollar EC sensors have limited their adoption. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a system, called Strobe, that senses soil moisture and soil EC using RF propagation in existing Wi-Fi bands. Strobe overcomes the key challenge of limited bandwidth availability in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed spectrum using a novel multi-antenna technique. It maps the propagation time and amplitude of Wi-Fi signals received by different antennas to the soil permittivity and EC, which in turn depend on soil moisture and salinity. Our experiments with USRP, WARP, and commodity Wi-Fi cards show that Strobe can accurately estimate soil moisture and EC using Wi-Fi, thereby showing the potential of a future in which a farmer can sense soil in their farm without investing 1000s of dollars in soil sensing equipments.",

Increasingly, edge devices (smartphones and consumer IoT devices) are equipped with pre-trained DNNs for a variety of applications. This trend comes with privacy risks as models can leak information about their training data through effective membership inference attacks (MIAs).We evaluate the performance of DarkneTZ, including CPU execution time, memory usage, and accurate power consumption, using two small and six large image classification models. Due to the limited memory of the edge device's TEE, we partition model layers into more sensitive layers (to be executed inside the device TEE), and a set of layers to be executed in the untrusted part of the operating system. Our results show that even if a single layer is hidden, we can provide reliable model privacy and defend against state of the art MIAs, with only 3% performance overhead. When fully utilizing the TEE, DarkneTZ provides model protections with up to 10% overhead.",

However, identifying the best-throughput MU-MIMO groups in commodity 802.11ac networks poses three major challenges: a) Commodity 802.11ac users do not provide full CSI feedback, which has been widely used for MU-MIMO grouping. b) Heterogeneous channel bandwidth users limit grouping opportunities. c) Limited-resource on APs cannot support computationally and memory expensive operations, required by existing algorithms. Hence, state-of-the-art designs are either not portable in 802.11ac APs, or perform poorly, as shown by our testbed experiments. In this paper, we design and implement MUSE, a lightweight user grouping algorithm, which addresses the above challenges. Our experiments with commodity 802.11ac testbeds show MUSE can achieve high throughput gains over existing designs.",
