Therefore, WiFi communication should be possible only between devices inside the same network. However, we have found that all existing WiFi devices send back acknowledgments (ACK) to even fake packets received from WiFi devices outside of their network. We call this behavior Polite WiFi since WiFi devices respond to all packets even those coming from strangers!In this paper, we discover the Polite WiFi behavior for the first time. We also examine this behavior on over 5,000 WiFi devices from 186 vendors. We find that all existing WiFi devices respond to fake packets transmitted to them. We believe this behavior creates many threats as well as opportunities. For example, one can couple this behavior with WiFi sensing and localization techniques to create a new class of security threats. In particular, by continuously sending fake frames to a target device, and measuring the properties of the ACK signal, one can extract sensitive personal information. Similarly, an attacker may use this behavior to quickly drain the battery of WiFi devices by continuously sending fake packets to them. Despite these threats, we also believe that the Polite WiFi behavior can open up new opportunities to WiFi sensing applications by making them more practical and easier to deploy.", "tags": ["sensitive personal information", "encryption mechanisms", "unauthorized devices", "wifi communication", "new opportunities", "security threats", "acknowledgments", "authentication", "wifi networks", "opportunities", "wifi devices", "strangers!in", "fake packets", "applications", "polite wifi", "fake frames", "devices", "ack"], "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 19th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks", "numpages": "7", "keywords": ["acknowledgment", "packet injection", "fake packet", "wifi sensing", "privacy", "threats", "security", "polite wifi"], "location": "Virtual Event, USA", "series": "HotNets '20"}]}, {"title": "WiTAG: Seamless WiFi Backscatter Communication", "path": "../static/editor/notes/3387514.3405866.md", "papers": [{"authors": [{"first": "Ali", "last": "Abedi"}, {"first": "Farzan", "last": "Dehbashi"}, {"first": "Mohammad Hossein", "last": "Mazaheri"}, {"first": "Omid", "last": "Abari"}, {"first": "Tim", "last": "Brecht"}], "title": "WiTAG: Seamless WiFi Backscatter Communication", "year": "2020", "isbn": "9781450379557", "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "address": "New York, NY, USA", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3387514.3405866", "doi": "10.1145/3387514.3405866", "abstract": "WiFi backscatter communication has the potential to enable battery-free sensors which can transmit data using a WiFi network. In order for WiFi backscatter systems to be practical they should be compatible with existing WiFi networks without any hardware or software modifications. Moreover, they should work with networks that use encryption. In this paper, we present WiTAG which achieves these requirements, making the implementation and deployment of WiFi backscatter communication more practical. In contrast with existing systems which utilize the physical layer for backscatter communication, we take a different approach by leveraging features of the MAC layer to communicate. WiTAG is designed to send data by selectively interfering with subframes (MPDUs) in an aggregated frame (A-MPDU). This enables standard compliant communication using modern, open or encrypted 802.11n and 802.11ac networks without requiring hardware or software modifications to any devices. We implement WiTAG using off-the-shelf components and evaluate its performance in line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight scenarios. We show that WiTAG achieves a throughput of up to 4 Kbps without impacting other devices in the network.", "tags": ["standard compliant communication", "wifi backscatter communication", "backscatter communication", "wifi backscatter systems", "battery-free sensors", "encryption", "deployment", "subframes", "the-shelf", "networks", "contrast", "features", "a-mpdu", "order", "witag", "mpdus", "sight", "data"], "booktitle": "Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication on the Applications, Technologies, Architectures, and Protocols for Computer Communication", "numpages": "13", "keywords": ["802.11 Networks", "Internet of Things (IoT)", "WiFi Backscatter", "Battery-free communication", "Sensors"], "location": "Virtual Event, USA", "series": "SIGCOMM '20"}]}]}
