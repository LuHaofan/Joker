However, identifying the best-throughput MU-MIMO groups in commodity 802.11ac networks poses three major challenges: a) Commodity 802.11ac users do not provide full CSI feedback, which has been widely used for MU-MIMO grouping. b) Heterogeneous channel bandwidth users limit grouping opportunities. c) Limited-resource on APs cannot support computationally and memory expensive operations, required by existing algorithms. Hence, state-of-the-art designs are either not portable in 802.11ac APs, or perform poorly, as shown by our testbed experiments. In this paper, we design and implement MUSE, a lightweight user grouping algorithm, which addresses the above challenges. Our experiments with commodity 802.11ac testbeds show MUSE can achieve high throughput gains over existing designs.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "13", "keywords": ["multi-user MIMO", "IEEE 802.11ac", "user selection"], "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
