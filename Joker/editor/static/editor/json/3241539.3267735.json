In this paper, we show how to use the barometers, which come with off-the-shelf smartphones, to improve vertical positioning accuracy. We will present performance testing results from different real road scenarios to show the feasibility of the proposed method.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["GPS", "vehicular networks", "navigation", "barometer"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
