By fostering an explicit and deep integration of the end-user directly into the design, analysis and management of large-scale operational networks, we expect to reduce the gap between QoE research and its application to future network management paradigms, as well as to provide a more targeted end-user perspective to the research on distributed communication systems. The 4th edition of Internet-QoE also focuses on novel end-user services enabled by next generation technologies such as immersive media (3D, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality), self-driving cars, intelligent manufacturing systems, Industry 4.0 and tactile Internet, 5G ultra-low-latency mobile networks, and real-time applications.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["distributed large-scale measurements", "quality of experience", "user engagement", "user experience", "interdisciplinary workshop"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
