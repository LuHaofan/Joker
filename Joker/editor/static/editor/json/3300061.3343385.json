State-of-art approaches with unmodified LCD(s) as optical modulator cause flickering with a sub-kbps low data rate, which would be overcome by modulating polarization, but naive implementation requires careful Tx-Rx placement to avoid signal cancellation. To overcome such challenges, we propose a new modulation scheme called polarization-based quadrature amplitude modulation (PQAM). PQAM constructs the orthogonal basis in the polarization domain and provides 2x throughput gain with arbitrary relative orientation.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["polarization", "tx-rx misalignment", "visible light backscatter communication"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
