We propose a concept and prototype system, ksystem, to automatically build a set of similar skills in the ecosystem (eco-skills) with one-time teaching from end users. During teaching, a user only needs to demonstrate on the screen in one (native) mobile app and provides natural language (NL) instructions.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["auto natural language development", "eco-skill development for ai assistants", "auto action fulfillment"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
