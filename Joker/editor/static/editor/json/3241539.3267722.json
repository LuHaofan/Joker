Currently, we have designed and developed the following products, COIN: Through our product COIN, we have created a proprietary low powered point to point mesh network of tiny low-cost sensor nodes having an effective communication speed of 1 Mbps and self-healing and self-learning capabilities. COIN can be used across various industries and for a wide range of applications which include, Asset tracking through warehouses, hospitals, airports etc., monitoring values for temperature, humidity, motion, and vibration. Threshold values can be set using our Web Control Panel to get real-time notifications if any value is crossed, also data can be streamed at regular intervals of time, People movement tracking &amp; safety monitoring as well as geo-fencing, security for perimeter/fence to avoid multiple intrusions and unauthorized entry. Using our COINS, -Asset movement can be tracked through warehouses, hospitals, airports etc, thus speeding up processes and eliminate errors by getting real-time location status of your assets. -COIN can monitor values for temperature, humidity, motion, and vibration. Threshold values can be set using our Web Control Panel to get real-time notifications if any value is crossed, also data can be streamed at regular intervals of time. -People movement tracking &amp; safety monitoring, as well as geo-fencing, is done in real time in confined environments such as offices, factories and so on. One can secure their entire perimeter/fence and avoid multiple intrusions and unauthorized entry. Also, get real-time alerts if any vibration or motion is detected.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["proprietary mesh network", "perimeter security.", "condition monitoring", "asset and people tracking", "coin"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
