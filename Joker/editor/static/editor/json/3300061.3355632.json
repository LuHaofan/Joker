As its name suggests, the workshop is organized by students, and the technical sessions are given by student presenters. The workshop aims at fostering early-career development among students and exposing them to the workings of academic life. It provides a venue for students to learn about each other's' work and discover opportunities for collaboration. The workshop invites students to submit papers, posters, and demos. All submissions are peer-reviewed by the student program committee.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["student workshop", "wireless", "mobile"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
