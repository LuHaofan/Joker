With a sharp climb of the amount of data being gathered due to an increasing number of mobile and wearable devices, real-time maintenance of Data Quality (DQ) of data-collection campaigns has already become an overwhelming task, especially in large-scale experiments. This paper proposes EasyTrack, a platform that collects large-scale data in an automatized manners. We describe how our proposed solution detects and tackles issues in data collection campaigns in an automated manner.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["wearable devices", "user studies", "streaming sensor data", "human-computer interaction", "human-centered computing", "data quality"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
