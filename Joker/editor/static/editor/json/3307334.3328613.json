We propose a real-time audio-based system that uses deep learning for not only detecting but also ranging and localization of a drone. In the proposed system scenario, each node records sound and sends it to the server after processing, and the server receives the data from each node and computes the final location of a drone. To explore the design space and investigate the feasibility of real-time acoustic ranging using deep learning, we first measure the drone detection accuracy and processing latency using two deep learning models (CNN, DNN) on both an embedded and a server-class device. By analyzing the relationship between detection probability and distance measurement, and comparing between binary and multi-class classification, we suggest a system design to range and localize the drone.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["drone", "deep learning", "UAV", "localization", "ranging"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
