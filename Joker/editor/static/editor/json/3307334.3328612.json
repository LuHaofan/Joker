This introduces novel opportunities for battery-free and ubiquitous sensing. We take advantage of backscatter communication to enable networked utensils. We imagine a scenario where such utensils can provide essential information about the state of the food or the beverage; for instance, the temperature or the quality of food contained in the utensils. We propose flex sensors, to achieve this capability, by augmenting utensils with flexible and inexpensive battery-free sensors that can communicate wirelessly. We demonstrate our efforts by designing a smart cup that tracks the temperature of the beverage.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["backscatter communication", "battery-free sensing", "food quality monitoring"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
