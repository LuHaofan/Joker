The developed sensor unit can operate at 267.21 mW and collect NO2 concentration, temperature, and relative humidity. The sensor unit was installed outdoors near a main road, for a 122 h experiment. The data collected from the sensor unit were stable. Further, the selected electrochemical NO2 sensor was effective, confirming that NO2 concentrations were high on weekdays (during heavy traffic) and low at night.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["air pollution", "monitoring system", "nitrogen dioxide"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
