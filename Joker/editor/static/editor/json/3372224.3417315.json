MAR involves computation-heavy algorithms that could potentially be offloaded to edge servers on 5G networks, which significantly enhances MAR with reduced communication latency and more stable network connections, therefore leading to seamless MAR user experiences. In this demo, we show a running MAR system deployed on a 5G edge test bed and present latency results.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3"}
