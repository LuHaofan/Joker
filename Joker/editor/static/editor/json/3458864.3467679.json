The proposed deep learning framework addresses a series of challenges. First, it encodes a 3D human body model, which enables mmMesh to estimate complex and realistic-looking 3D human meshes from sparse point clouds. Second, it can accurately align the 3D points with their corresponding body segments despite the influence of ambient points as well as the error-prone nature and the multi-path effect of the RF signals. Third, the proposed model can infer missing body parts from the information of the previous frames. Our evaluation results on a commercial mmWave sensing testbed show that our mmMesh system can accurately localize the vertices on the human mesh with an average error of 2.47 cm. The superior experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed human mesh construction system.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "14", "keywords": ["millimeter wave", "human sensing", "deep learning", "point cloud", "human mesh estimation"], "location": "Virtual Event, Wisconsin", "series": "MobiSys '21"}
