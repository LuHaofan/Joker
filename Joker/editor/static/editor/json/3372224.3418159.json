They consume more energy, dissipate more power, and heat up faster. So, millimeter-wave (mmWave) would exacerbate the device overheating problem in the future. In this work, we first perform a thermal characterization of mmWave devices: it reveals that after only 10 s. of data transfer at 1.9 Gbps, the antenna temperature reaches 68\u00b0C; it reduces the link throughput by 21%, increases the standard deviation by 6\\texttimes{}, and takes 130 s. to dissipate the heat completely. We then propose Aquilo to bring temperature-awareness in mmWave networks; Aquilo maintains relatively high throughput performance and cools down the devices substantially. Our testbed experiments in static conditions show that Aquilo reaches a median peak temperature just 1\u00b0C above the optimal with less than 10% throughput sacrifice only.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3"}
