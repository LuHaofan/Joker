Vulcan first builds a state-model of a wearable app by offline training then steers the app to a target state for injecting mutated messages. The target state of the app typically runs a high number of concurrent processes. By testing a set of 100 popular Wear OS apps, Vulcan was able to trigger 45 unique crashes and 18 system reboots. These system reboots are triggered by a fuzzing user-level app and we present a mitigation strategy to prevent it.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["Wear OS", "reliability", "wearable", "android", "fuzzer"], "location": "Toronto, Ontario, Canada", "series": "MobiSys '20"}
