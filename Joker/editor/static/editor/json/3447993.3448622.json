The main advantage of WiFi backscatter technologies over RFID is that data from their tags can be read using existing WiFi infrastructures instead of specialized readers. This can potentially reduce the complexity and cost of deploying battery-free sensors. Despite extensive work in this area, none of the existing systems are in widespread use today. We hypothesize that this is because WiFi-based backscatter tags do not scale well and their range and capabilities are limited when compared with RFID. To test this hypothesis we conduct several real-world experiments.We compare WiFi backscatter and RFID technologies in terms of RF harvesting capabilities, throughput, range and scalability. Our results show that existing WiFi backscatter tags cannot rely on RF harvesting (as opposed to RFID tags) due to their high power consumption. We find that WiFi backscatter tags must be quite close to a WiFi device to work robustly in non-line-of-sight scenarios, limiting their operating range. Furthermore, our results show that some WiFi backscatter systems can cause significant interference for existing WiFi traffic and be affected by them since they do not perform carrier sensing.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 27th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "11"}
