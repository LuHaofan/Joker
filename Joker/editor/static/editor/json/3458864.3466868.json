The bandwidth of current systems ranges from 160 MHz for IEEE 802.11ac/ax to 2 GHz for Millimeter-Wave (mm-wave) IEEE 802.11ad/ay, and they support up to 8 spatial MIMO streams. Mobile 5G and beyond systems have a similarly diverse set of requirements.To address this, we propose a highly configurable wireless platform that meets such requirements and is both affordable and scalable. It is implemented on a single state-of-the-art FPGA board that can be configured from 4x4 mm-wave MIMO with 2 GHz channels to 8x8 MIMO with 160 MHz channels in sub-6 GHz bands. In addition, multi-band operation will play an important role in future wireless networks and our platform supports mixed configurations with simultaneous use of mm-wave and sub-6 GHz. Finally, the platform supports real-time operation, e.g., for closed-loop MIMO beam training with low-latency, by implementing suitable hardware/software accelerators. We demonstrate the platform's performance in a wide range of experiments. The platform is provided as open-source to build a community to use and extend it.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "13", "keywords": ["FPGA", "phased antenna array", "multi-band", "millimeter wave", "MIMO", "testbed"], "location": "Virtual Event, Wisconsin", "series": "MobiSys '21"}
