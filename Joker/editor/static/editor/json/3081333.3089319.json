This empowers operators of large airports and retail facilities to optimize cost-intensive resource allocation as well as to provide location-based services to their customers such as geo-fencing and proximity marketing. However, existing PIPS often generate noisy location estimates due to unpredictable interference and attenuation of wireless signals in indoor environments. To address this problem, we propose a novel map matching approach that uses a floor map to constrain location estimates to possible paths a mobile user can take.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["map matching", "passive indoor positioning system", "hidden Markov model"], "location": "Niagara Falls, New York, USA", "series": "MobiSys '17"}
