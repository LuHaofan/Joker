Concatenating virtual network functions (VNFs) into service function chains (SFCs) provides flexible and diverse network support for intelligent applications. However, the mobile network connection is very unreliable. A reasonable SFC composition mechanism is essential for stable service providing. This paper proposes a high availability service function chain composition approach, TSFCC. TSFCC includes real-time road marking strategy, bi-composition mechanism, and VNF reallocation mechanism. Evaluation results prove that TSFCC can adapt to the mobile network environment and provide users with efficient and highly available SFC service.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3"}
