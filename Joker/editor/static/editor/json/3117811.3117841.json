However, a mobile GPU constitutes a major portion of power consumption on the devices, and mobile games top as the most popular class of graphics applications. This paper presents the design and implementation of RAVEN, a novel, on-the-fly frame rate scaling system for mobile gaming applications. RAVEN utilizes human visual perception of graphics change to opportunistically achieve power saving without degrading user experiences. The system develops a light-weight frame comparison technique to measure and predict perception-aware frame similarity. It also builds a low resolution virtual display which clones the device screen for performing similarity measurement at a low-power cost. It is able to work on an existing commercial smartphone and support applications from app stores without any modifications. It has been implemented on Nexus 5X, and its performance has been measured with 13 games. The system effectively reduces the overall power consumption of mobile devices while maintaining satisfactory user experiences. The power consumption is reduced by 21.78% on aver-age and up to 34.74%.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "13", "keywords": ["mobile games", "mobile systems", "frame-rate scaling", "measurement", "energy-efficient processing", "experiments", "perception-aware processing"], "location": "Snowbird, Utah, USA", "series": "MobiCom '17"}
