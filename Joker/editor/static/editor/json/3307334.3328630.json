While coalescing storage and networking security scheme can reduce redundent and unnecessary operations, we identify security- and system-level challenges that can occur when applying DTLS. FDTLS addresses these challenges by employing asymmetric key generation, a virtual peer, and header reduction-based storage optimization. Our results obtained using a Contiki-based implementation on OpenMote platforms show that compared to using storage and networking security separately, FDTLS can reduce the latency of packet transmission responses and also contribute to saving energy.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["dtls", "self-key generation", "secure internet of things"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
