SDC achieves this through a novel high-resolution heat sensing and actuation system that uses microwave-safe components to augment existing microwaves. In this demo, we demonstrate our experimental test-bed, a modified commercial off-the-shelf microwave oven, and show a SDC-enabled microwave can be enlisted to perform unexpected cooking tasks: cooking meat and fat in bacon discriminatively and heating rice uniformly.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["microwave", "radio actuation", "computational design"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
