Hence, they are an attractive foundation for environmental sensing. Although RFID-based sensors have been studied in the research literature and are also available commercially, manufacturing them has been a technically-challenging task that is typically undertaken only by experienced researchers. In this paper, we show how even hobbyists can transform commodity RFID tags into sensors by physically altering (`hacking') them using COTS sensors, a pair of scissors, and clear adhesive tape. Importantly, this requires no change to commercial RFID readers. We also propose a new legacy-compatible tag reading protocol called Differential Minimum Response Threshold (DMRT) that is robust to the changes in an RF environment. To validate our vision, we develop RFID-based sensors for illuminance, temperature, touch, and gestures. We believe that our approach has the potential to open up the field of batteryless backscatter-based RFID sensing to the research community, making it an exciting area for future work.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "10", "keywords": ["modification", "rfid", "sensor", "antenna"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
