We propose a new wearable ADM system that could be used daily by real-world users. It is designed in a form of necklace, providing natural and firm contact of sensor on user's skin to accurately capture eating activities. At our preliminary experiments, our wearable ADM system detected eating of a user with 86.1% accuracy.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["automatic dietary monitoring", "eating episode detection", "food journal"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
