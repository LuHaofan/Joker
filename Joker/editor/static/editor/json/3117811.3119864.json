BatMapper operates by emitting sound signal and capturing its reflections by two microphones on smartphones. We develop robust probabilistic echo-object association and outlier removal algorithms to identify the correspondence between distances and objects, thus the geometry of corridors. We compensate minute hand sway movements to identify small surface recessions, thus detecting doors automatically. Additionally, we leverage structure cues in indoor environments for user trace calibration. The demo will enable any person to hold the smartphone and walk along a corridor to map the corridor shape and detect doors in real-time.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["indoor floor plans", "acoustic sensing", "smartphones"], "location": "Snowbird, Utah, USA", "series": "MobiCom '17"}
