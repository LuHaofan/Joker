To do so, we focus on scenarios when many smart devices compete for cellular resources in the same base station: spreading out transmissions over time so that only a few devices transmit at once and improves both spectral efficiency and battery consumption. To this end, we devise two novel features in CASTLE. First, we explicitly consider inter-cell interference for accurate cellular load estimation in our machine learning algorithm. Second, we propose a fully distributed scheduling algorithm that coordinates transmissions between clients based on the locally estimated load level at each client. Our formulation for minimizing battery consumption at each device leads to an optimized back off-based algorithm that fits practical environments. Our comprehensive experimental results show that CASTLE's load estimation is up to 91 % accurate, and that CASTLE achieves higher spectral efficiency with less battery consumption, compared to existing centralized scheduling algorithms as well as a distributed CSMA-like protocol. Furthermore,we develop a light-weight SDK that can expedite the deployment of CASTLE into smart devices and evaluate it in a commercial LTE network.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["cell load", "distributed scheduling", "energy saving", "lte"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
