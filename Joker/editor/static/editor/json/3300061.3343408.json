We conduct a large-scale measurement campaign on appname, an operational mobile video telephony service. Our analysis shows that the application-layer video codec and transport-layer protocols remain highly uncoordinated, which represents one major reason for the low QoE. We thus propose name, a machine learning based framework to resolve the issue. We train name with the massive data traces from the measurement campaign using a custom-designed imitation learning algorithm, which enables name to learn from past experience following an expert's iterative demonstration/supervision. We have implemented and incorporated name into the appname. Our experiments show that name outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, improving video quality while reducing stalling time by multi-folds under various practical scenarios.", "booktitle": "The 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["video telephony", "bitrate adaptation", "imitation learning"], "location": "Los Cabos, Mexico", "series": "MobiCom '19"}
