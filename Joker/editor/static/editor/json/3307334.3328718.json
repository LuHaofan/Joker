As an alternative, a probabilistic model for dynamic input aiming on signals from multiple cellular station is proposed in this study, and the feasibility was verified. The result from the experiment can be shown a little petty, but if one experiments in a better environment and utilizes LTE and 5G network, about 20~30m of the positioning error can be expected.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["cellular positioning", "grid", "gaussian model"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
