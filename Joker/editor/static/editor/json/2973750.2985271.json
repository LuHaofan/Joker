ToneSense encodes information into the transmission power levels of regular frames. Receivers sense the power strength and decode as meaningful information bits. Evaluations show that ToneSense achieves \u2264 4% symbol error rate. Our work sheds light on wireless coexistence problems and cross-technology communications.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["power strength", "cross technology", "2.4GHz", "wireless"], "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
