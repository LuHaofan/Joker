However, most of the existing PIR-based localization systems only utilize the binary information of PIR sensors and therefore require a large number of carefully deployed PIR sensors. A few works directly map the raw data of PIR sensors to one's location using machine learning approaches. However, these data-driven approaches require abundant training data and suffer from environmental change. In this paper, we propose PIRATES, a PIR-based device-free localization system based on the raw data of PIR sensors. The key of PIRATES is to extract a new type of location information called azimuth change. The extraction of the azimuth change relies on the physical properties of PIR sensors. Therefore, no abundant training data are needed and the system is robust to environmental change. Through experiments, we demonstrate that PIRATES can achieve higher localization accuracy than the state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, the information of the azimuth change can be easily incorporated with other information of PIR signals (e.g. amplitude) to improve the localization accuracy.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "14"}
