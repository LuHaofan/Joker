In particular, meChat understands the semantics of on-going conversation and in-device photos by projecting both of them into a single semantic space. Subsequently, it retrieves in-device photos related to the conversation context. Through this process, meChat makes it easy for the users to share the photos while communicating in messaging applications. In addition, it is worth noting that meChat works in a stand-alone, privacy-protecting manner without sending out any in-device photos and conversations to the external servers. This is different from existing photo services (e.g., Google Photos) which resort on the cloud server.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["on-device intelligence", "personal service"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
