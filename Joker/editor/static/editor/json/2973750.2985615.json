This demo brings forward a concept of 'communication is sensing', which is to make sense of the world purely based on communication carrier rather than specialized sensors. In this demo, we present an RFID-based solution, called Tagbeat, to inspect mechanical vibration using COTS RFID tags and readers. We implement our system using a COTS RFID device and evaluate it with a commercial centrifugal machine. Empirical benchmarks with a prototype show that our system can inspect the vibration period with a mean accuracy of 0.36ms and a relative error rate of 0.03%.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
