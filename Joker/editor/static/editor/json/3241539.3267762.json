Scaling of network slices is required to cope with the resources needed for peak traffic demand. In this paper, we demonstrate scaling of network slices based on the type of network slice such as enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC) in order to ensure Service Level Agreement (SLA) guarantees of the network slices with the help of our proposed Network Slicing Profiler (NSP) and Network Slice Scaling Function (NSSF) in an ETSI MANO based network slicing framework.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["orchestration", "network slicing", "scaling in 5G", "NFV"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
