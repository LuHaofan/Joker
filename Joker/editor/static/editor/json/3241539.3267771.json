This paper proposes an active visual recognition approach to this problem, leveraging camera pose data available on mobile devices. With this approach, the state of a 3D object, which captures its appearance changes, can be recognized in real time. Our novel approach selects informative video frames filtered by 6-DOF camera poses to train a deep learning model to recognize object state. We validate our approach through a prototype for Augmented Reality-assisted hardware maintenance.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["mobile devices", "active visual recognition", "augmented reality"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
