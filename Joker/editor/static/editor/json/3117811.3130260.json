Some of the most common systems have become commoditized, enabling higher-layer application-driven research while at the same time inhibiting lower-layer research. On the other hand, new frontiers of wireless communications are opening up in various spectrum bands hitherto not used for wireless data communications. This talk will cover the future of wireless systems-driven research and contributions to science &amp; technology from the vantage point of the National Science Foundation.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["PAWR", "ubiquitous computing", "wireless spectrum", "wireless systems"], "location": "Snowbird, Utah, USA", "series": "MobiCom '17"}
