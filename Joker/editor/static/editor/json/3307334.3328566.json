Users can freely select the viewpoint, zoom in and zoom out to enjoy the full quality of the 8K resolu- tion using any Samsung GearVR compatible smartphone. We also present how our system works internally to dynamically adjust margin size to accommodate to network latency and how our ap- proach can save up to 80% bandwidth compared to streaming full video to mobile devices.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["mobile vr", "360 degree video", "mobile edge cloud"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
