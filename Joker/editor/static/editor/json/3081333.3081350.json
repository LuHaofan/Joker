However, existing fast charging solutions are agnostic of users' available time for charging their devices, causing early termination of the intended/planned charging. This, in turn, accelerates the capacity fading of device battery and thus shortens the device operation. In this paper, we propose a novel user-interactive charging paradigm, called iCharge, that tailors the device charging to the user's real-time availability and need. The core of iCharge is a relaxation-aware (R-Aware) charging algorithm that maximizes the charged capacity within the user's available time and slows down the battery's capacity fading. iCharge also integrates R-Aware with existing fast charging algorithms via a user-interactive interface, allowing users to choose a charging method based on their availability and need. We evaluate iCharge via extensive laboratory experiments and field-tests on Android phones, as well as user studies. R-Aware is shown to slow down the battery fading by more than 36% on average, and up to 60% in extreme cases, when compared to existing fast charging algorithms. This slowdown of capacity fading translates to, for instance, an up to 2-hour extension of the LTE time for a Nexus 5X phone after its use for 2 years, according to our trace-driven analysis of 976 device charging cases of 7 users over 3 months.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "14", "keywords": ["battery relaxation", "user-interactive charging", "battery fading", "mobile devices"], "location": "Niagara Falls, New York, USA", "series": "MobiSys '17"}
