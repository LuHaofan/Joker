Our system innovatively re-uses widely available WiFi signals to capture the unique physiological characteristics rooted in respiratory motions for continuous authentication. Different from existing continuous authentication approaches having limited applicable scenarios due to their dependence on restricted user behaviors (e.g., keystrokes and gaits) or dedicated sensing infrastructures, our approach can be easily integrated into any existing WiFi infrastructure to provide non-invasive continuous authentication independent of user behaviors. Specifically, we extract representative features leveraging waveform morphology analysis and fuzzy wavelet transformation of respiration signals derived from the readily available channel state information (CSI) of WiFi. A respiration-based user authentication scheme is developed to accurately identify users and reject spoofers. Extensive experiments involving 20 subjects demonstrate that the proposed system can achieve a high authentication success rate of over 93% and robustly defend against various types of attacks.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["continuous authentication", "WiFi", "breathing"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
