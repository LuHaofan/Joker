MobileInsight runs on commercial off-the-shelf phones without extra hardware or additional support from cellular network operators. It exposes cellular protocol messages from the 3G/4G chipset, and performs in-device protocol analysis. We demonstrate the in-device runtime cellular message collection, analysis of the protocol states, visualization of runtime wireless channel and mobility dynamics, and how mobile applications benefit from MobileInsight.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
