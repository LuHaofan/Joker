These bugs, or errata, can cause unexpected behaviors, reducing performance and causing malfunctions in the entire system. As there is no way to fix an erratum after hardware is deployed, its harmful effects are often mitigated by software workarounds, usually in low-level software such as operating system. The goal of our work is to ensure system correctness and security against the harmful effects of errata and their workarounds. The first step is to systematically understand them in the wild.In this poster, we present our early results from analyzing errata in the ARM Cortex-A family of microarchitecture, introduced by ARM itself, and their workarounds. We studied publicly available ARM errata documentations and examined source code of low-level software, namely Linux kernel, U-Boot and ARM Trusted firmware.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["software workarounds", "ARM errata", "types of errata fixes"], "location": "Niagara Falls, New York, USA", "series": "MobiSys '17"}
