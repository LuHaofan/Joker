These resources have different levels of security and usage constraint in scenarios which have different requirements for privacy. Therefore, it is in demand for users to have fine-grained privacy protection and resources usage constraint that taking the context information into account, which is not supported by inherent access control mechanism of Android. To address these issues, we designed and implemented an enhanced context-aware adaptive access control system (EasyGuard) in Android to provide adaptive access control automatically when the specific context is detected according to the pre-configured policies. In addition, we developed an application to facilitate users that have little domain knowledge in android to configure policies reasonably. Experimental results show that users can easily protect their privacy, security and save energy of mobile devices through this system.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "2", "keywords": ["access control", "privacy", "context-aware", "power saving"], "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
