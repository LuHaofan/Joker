This is because Bluetooth consumes much less power than WiFi which results in longer battery life. The higher power consumption of WiFi devices is due to overheads from either establishing or maintaining connections with the access point. Surprisingly, Bluetooth devices require nearly three times as much energy to transmit a bit of data at the physical layer than WiFi devices.In this paper, we propose Wi-LE a WiFi-compatible communication system that avoids the power hungry process of establishing or maintaining a connection. We implement and evaluate Wi-LE using an off-the-shelf WiFi module. Our results show that Wi-LE has power consumption similar to that of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This demonstrates the potential for Wi-LE to be used in place of BLE.", "tags": ["low-power, low data-rate devices", "bluetooth low energy", "longer battery life", "bluetooth devices", "power consumption", "communication", "wifi devices", "connections", "bluetooth", "overheads", "the-shelf", "wi-le", "place", "wifi", "data", "ble"], "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 18th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks", "numpages": "8", "location": "Princeton, NJ, USA", "series": "HotNets '19"}
