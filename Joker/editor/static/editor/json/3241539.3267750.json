However, the information decoder recovers the complete data by utilizing the sparse behaviour of the real world signal, thus not compromising the system performance, unlike the conventional SWIPT protocols such as time switching and power splitting.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "3", "keywords": ["sparsity", "simultaneous information and power transfer", "energy harvesting"], "location": "New Delhi, India", "series": "MobiCom '18"}
