MobileInsight runs on commercial off-the-shelf phones without extra hardware or additional support from operators. It exposes protocol messages on both control plane and (below IP) data plane from the 3G/4G chipset. It provides in-device protocol analysis and operation logic inference. It further offers a simple API, through which developers and researchers obtain access to low-level network information for their mobile applications. We have built three showcases to illustrate how MobileInsight is applied to cellular network research.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking", "numpages": "14", "location": "New York City, New York", "series": "MobiCom '16"}
