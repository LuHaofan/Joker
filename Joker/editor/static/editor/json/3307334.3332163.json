However, the tremendous device, hardware, and software heterogeneity of mobile systems makes this difficult. In this demo, we present M2, a system for multi-mobile computing that enables existing unmodified mobile apps to make use of new ways of sharing and combining multiple devices. M2 introduces a new data-centric approach that leverages higher-level device abstractions and encoding/decoding hardware to efficiently share device data as opposed to low-level device-specific APIs.", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services", "numpages": "1", "keywords": ["android", "mobile computing", "operating systems", "ios", "distributed computing", "mobile devices", "remote display"], "location": "Seoul, Republic of Korea", "series": "MobiSys '19"}
