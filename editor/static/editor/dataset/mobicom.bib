abstract = {Should you decide to launch a nano-satellite today in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO), the cost of renting ground station communication infrastructure is likely to significantly exceed your launch costs. While space launch costs have lowered significantly with innovative launch vehicles, private players, and smaller payloads, access to ground infrastructure remains a luxury. This is especially true for smaller LEO satellites that are only visible at any location for a few tens of minutes a day and whose signals are extremely weak, necessitating bulky and expensive ground station infrastructure.In this paper, we present a community-driven distributed reception paradigm for LEO satellite signals where signals received on many tiny handheld receivers (not necessarily deployed on rooftops but also indoors) are coherently combined to recover the desired signal. This is made possible by employing new synchronization and receiver orientation techniques that study satellite trajectories and leverage the presence of other ambient signals. We compare our results with a large commercial receiver deployed on a rooftop and show a 8 dB SNR increase both indoors and outdoors using 8 receivers, costing $38 per RF frontend.},

abstract = {Emerging applications like distributed coordinated beamforming (DCB), intelligent reflector arrays, and networked robotic devices will transform wireless applications. However, for systems-centric work on these topics, the research community must first overcome the hurdle of implementing fine-grained, over-the-air timing synchronization, which is critical for any coordinated operation. To address this gap, this paper presents an open-source design and implementation of 'RFClock' that provides timing, frequency and phase synchronization for software defined radios (SDRs). It shows how RFClock can be used for a practical, 5-node DCB application without modifying existing physical/link layer protocols. By utilizing a leader-follower architecture, RFClock-leader allows follower clocks to synchronize with mean offset under 0.107Hz, and then corrects the time/phase alignment to be within a 5ns deviation. RFClock is designed to operate in generalized environments: as standalone unit, it generates a 10MHz/1PPS signal reference suitable for most commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) SDRs today; it does not require custom protocol-specific headers or messaging; and it is robust to interference through a frequency-agile operation. Using RFClock for DCB, we verify significant increase in channel gain and low BER in a range of [0 -- 10--3] for different modulation schemes. We also demonstrate performance that is similar to a popular wired solution and significant improvement over a GPS-based solution, while delivering this functionality at a fractional price/power point.},

In this work, we present ParaMax, a MIMO detector architecture that for the first time brings to bear physics-inspired parallel tempering algorithmic techniques [28, 50, 67] on this class of problems. ParaMax can achieve near optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) throughput performance in the Large MIMO regime, Massive MIMO systems where the base station has additional RF chains, to approach the number of base station antennas, in order to support even more parallel spatial streams. ParaMax is able to achieve a near ML-BER performance up to 160 \texttimes{} 160 and 80 \texttimes{} 80 Large MIMO for low-order modulations such as BPSK and QPSK, respectively, only requiring less than tens of processing elements. With respect to Massive MIMO systems, in 12 \texttimes{} 24 MIMO with 16-QAM at SNR 16 dB, ParaMax achieves 330 Mbits/s near-optimal system throughput with 4--8 processing elements per subcarrier, which is approximately 1.4\texttimes{} throughput than linear detector-based Massive MIMO systems.},

We develop Millimetro in the context of autonomous driving to efficiently localize roadside infrastructure such as lane markers and road signs, even if obscured from view, where visual sensing fails. While RF-based localization offers a natural solution, current ultra-low-power localization systems struggle to operate accurately at extended ranges under strict latency requirements. Millimetro addresses this challenge by re-using existing automotive radars that operate at mmWave frequency where plentiful bandwidth is available to ensure high accuracy and low latency. We address the crucial free space path loss problem experienced by signals from the tag at mmWave bands by building upon Van Atta Arrays that retro-reflect incident energy back towards the transmitting radar with minimal loss and low power consumption. Our experimental results indoors and outdoors demonstrate a scalable system that operates at a desirable range (over 100 m), accuracy (centimeter-level), and ultra-low-power (&lt; 3 uW).},

To alleviate this issue, this work presents WiBeacon, which repurposes ubiquitously deployed WiFi access points (AP) into virtual BLE beacons via only moderate software upgrades. Specifically, a WiBeacon-enabled AP can broadcast elaborately designed WiFi packets that could be recognized as iBeacon-compatible location identifiers by unmodified mobile BLE devices. This offers fast deployment of BLE LBS with zero additional hardware costs and low maintenance burdens. WiBeacon is carefully integrated with native WiFi services, retaining transparency to WiFi clients. We implement WiBeacon on commodity WiFi APs (with various chipsets such as Qualcomm, Broadcom, and MediaTek) and extensively evaluate it across various scenarios, including a real commercial application for courier check-ins. During the two-week pilot study, WiBeacon provides reliable services, i.e., as robust as conventional BLE beacons, for 697 users with 150 types of smartphones.},

abstract = {WiFi backscatter communication has been proposed to enable battery-free sensors to transmit data using WiFi networks. The main advantage of WiFi backscatter technologies over RFID is that data from their tags can be read using existing WiFi infrastructures instead of specialized readers. This can potentially reduce the complexity and cost of deploying battery-free sensors. Despite extensive work in this area, none of the existing systems are in widespread use today. We hypothesize that this is because WiFi-based backscatter tags do not scale well and their range and capabilities are limited when compared with RFID. To test this hypothesis we conduct several real-world experiments.We compare WiFi backscatter and RFID technologies in terms of RF harvesting capabilities, throughput, range and scalability. Our results show that existing WiFi backscatter tags cannot rely on RF harvesting (as opposed to RFID tags) due to their high power consumption. We find that WiFi backscatter tags must be quite close to a WiFi device to work robustly in non-line-of-sight scenarios, limiting their operating range. Furthermore, our results show that some WiFi backscatter systems can cause significant interference for existing WiFi traffic and be affected by them since they do not perform carrier sensing.},

abstract = {Barcodes and NFC have become the de facto standards in the field of automatic identification and data capture. These standards have been widely adopted for many applications, such as mobile payments, advertisements, social sharing, admission control, and so on. Recently, considerable demands require the integration of these two codes (barcode and NFC code) into a single tag for the functional complementation. To achieve the goal of "one tag, two codes" (OTTC), this work proposes CoilCode, which takes advantage of the printed electronics to fuse an NFC coil antenna into a QR code on a single layer. The proposed code could be identified by cameras and NFC readers. With the use of the conductive inks, QR code and NFC code have become an essential part of each other: the modules of the QR code facilitate the NFC chip in harvesting energy from the magnetic field, while the NFC antenna itself represents bits of the QR code. Compared to the prior dual-layer OTTC, CoilCode is more compact, cost-effective, flimsy, flexible, and environment-friendly, and also reduces the fabrication complexity considerably. We prototyped hundreds of CoilCodes and conducted comprehensive evaluations (across 4 models of NFC chips and 8 kinds of NFC readers under 13 different system configurations). CoilCode demonstrates high-quality identification results for QR code and NFC functions on a wide range of inputs and under different distortion effects.},

abstract = {To take advantage of Visible Light Communication (VLC) for low-power applications, such as IoT tags, researchers have been developing systems to modulate (backscatter) ambient light using LC shutters. Various approaches have been explored for single-pixel transmitters, but without following a principled approach. This has resulted in either relatively low data rates, short ranges, or the need for powerful artificial light sources. This paper takes a step back and proposes a more theoretical framework: ChromaLux. By considering the fundamental characteristics of liquid crystals (birefringence and thickness), we demonstrate that the design space is way larger than previously explored, allowing for much better systems. In particular, we uncover the existence of a transient state where the switching time can be reduced by an order of magnitude without lowering the contrast significantly, improving both range and data rate. Using a prototype, we demonstrate that our framework is applicable to different LCs. Our results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art single-pixel systems, achieving ranges of 50 meters at 1 kbps and with bit-error-rates below 1%.},

abstract = {Headphones continue to become more intelligent as new functions (e.g., touch-based gesture control) appear. These functions usually rely on auxiliary sensors (e.g., accelerometer and gyroscope) that are available in smart headphones. However, for those headphones that do not have such sensors, supporting these functions becomes a daunting task. This paper presents HeadFi, a new design paradigm for bringing intelligence to headphones. Instead of adding auxiliary sensors into headphones, HeadFi turns the pair of drivers that are readily available inside all headphones into a versatile sensor to enable new applications spanning across mobile health, user-interface, and context-awareness. HeadFi works as a plug-in peripheral connecting the headphones and the pairing device (e.g., a smartphone). The simplicity (can be as simple as only two resistors) and small form factor of this design lend itself to be embedded into the pairing device as an integrated circuit. We envision HeadFi can serve as a vital supplementary solution to existing smart headphone design by directly transforming large amounts of existing "dumb" headphones into intelligent ones. We prototype HeadFi on PCB and conduct extensive experiments with 53 volunteers using 54 pairs of non-smart headphones under the institutional review board (IRB) protocols. The results show that HeadFi can achieve 97.2%--99.5% accuracy on user identification, 96.8%--99.2% accuracy on heart rate monitoring, and 97.7%--99.3% accuracy on gesture recognition.},

Solving this task with single-channel, audio-only methods remains an open challenge, especially for practical scenarios involving a mixture of competing speakers and background noise. In this paper, we propose UltraSE, which uses ultrasound sensing as a complementary modality to separate the desired speaker's voice from interferences and noise. UltraSE uses a commodity mobile device (e.g., smartphone) to emit ultrasound and capture the reflections from the speaker's articulatory gestures. It introduces a multi-modal, multi-domain deep learning framework to fuse the ultrasonic Doppler features and the audible speech spectrogram. Furthermore, it employs an adversarially trained discriminator, based on a cross-modal similarity measurement network, to learn the correlation between the two heterogeneous feature modalities. Our experiments verify that UltraSE simultaneously improves speech intelligibility and quality, and outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by a large margin.},

This paper shows the feasibility of identifying unknown liquids with commercial lightweight devices, such as a smartphone. The wisdom arises from the fact that different liquid molecules have various viscosity coefficients, so they need to overcome dissimilitude energy barriers during relative motion. With this intuition in mind, we introduce a novel model that measures liquids' viscosity based on active vibration. Yet, it is challenging to build up a robust system utilizing the built-in accelerometer in smartphones. Practical issues include under-sampling, self-interference, and volume change impact. Instead of machine learning, we tackle these issues through multiple signal processing stages to reconstruct the original signals and cancel out the interference. Our approach could achieve the liquid viscosity estimates with a mean relative error of 2.9% and distinguish 30 kinds of liquid with an average accuracy of 95.47%.},

abstract = {On-device deep learning (DL) inference has attracted vast interest. Mobile CPUs are the most common hardware for on-device inference and many inference frameworks have been developed for them. Yet, due to the hardware complexity, DL inference on mobile CPUs suffers from two common issues: the poor performance scalability on the asymmetric multiprocessor, and energy inefficiency.We identify the root causes are improper task partitioning and unbalanced task distribution for the poor scalability, and unawareness of model behaviour for energy inefficiency. Based on that, we propose a novel technique called AsyMo for the thread pool implementation of DL frameworks to solve the two issues. The key design principle is to leverage the execution determinism of DL inference, and build an optimal execution plan offline by jointly considering model structures and hardware characteristics. For performance scalability, AsyMo implements cost-model-directed partitioning and asymmetry-aware task scheduling to properly divide and fairly schedule tasks on asymmetric CPUs. For energy saving, AsyMo determines the least-energy cost frequency based on data reuse rate of a model.AsyMo is evaluated on different models and DL frameworks. All gain substantial improvement. For example, AsyMo shows up to 46% performance and 37% energy-efficiency improvement for convolution-dominant models, and up to 97% performance and 1.22\texttimes{} energy-efficiency improvement for fully-connect-dominant models, compared to an optimized TensorFlow on off-the-shelf mobile CPUs.},

Yet, it is challenging to protect privacy while still preserving desired VSA features, i.e., effective analytics, forensic support, resource efficiency, and real-time execution. In this paper, we present a VSA privacy enhancement system (PECAM), which addresses the above challenge with no change in the VSA back-end. PECAM leverages a novel Generative Adversarial Network to perform the privacy-enhanced securely-reversible video transformation. PECAM also incorporates a couple of system optimizations into its VSA workflow to reduce network bandwidth usage and enable real-time processing on cameras. We implement our PECAM prototype on commodity hardware and evaluate its performance via both security study and extensive experiments. Results demonstrate that PECAM can effectively enhance the visual privacy of VSA in the presence of an adversary, and its transformed videos, when taken as input for various VSA back-end tasks, maintain a 96% accuracy of corresponding original videos. Additionally, it performs 12.3\texttimes{} and 1.8\texttimes{} better than baseline methods in terms of the computing cost and network bandwidth usage, respectively.},

abstract = {Carrying over 75% of the last-mile mobile Internet traffic, WiFi has inevitably become an enticing target for various security threats. In this work, we characterize a wide variety of real-world WiFi threats at an unprecedented scale, involving 19 million WiFi access points (APs) mostly located in China, by deploying a crowdsourced security checking system on 14 million mobile devices in the wild. Leveraging the collected data, we reveal the landscape of nationwide WiFi threats for the first time. We find that the prevalence, riskiness, and breakdown of WiFi threats deviate significantly from common understandings and prior studies. In particular, we detect attacks at around 4% of all WiFi APs, uncover that most WiFi attacks are driven by an underground economy, and provide strong evidence of web analytics platforms being the bottleneck of its monetization chain. Further, we provide insightful guidance for defending against WiFi attacks at scale, and some of our efforts have already yielded real-world impact---effectively disrupted the WiFi attack ecosystem.},

abstract = {In industrialized wine production, brewing and aging are two key steps. These two processes require the liquors to be bottled for a long time, sometimes more than ten years. The liquor is vulnerable and highly susceptible to microbial contamination during storage, causing undetectable deterioration. During the production process, wineries control the indoor temperature and carbon dioxide concentration to slow down other microorganisms' reproduction speed. These methods, however, do not prevent pathogenic microorganism growth. Currently, microbial culture methods are not suitable for real-time liquor quality monitoring in wineries. Therefore, we have designed a lightweight monitoring system called Lili, which uses light signals to monitor real-time liquor quality changes. Lili detects the changes in surface tension and absorption spectrum caused by microbial metabolites and growth during deterioration. Lili employs eight LEDs and one photodiode to achieve fine-grained surface tension and absorption spectrum measurements. By analyzing these changes, Lili realizes real-time quality monitoring. In this paper, the characteristic offset degree measurement and the absorption spectrum dimension expansion are two critical technologies. In addition, we implemented countermeasures against ambient light noise and sloshing interference. Lili's surface tension and absorption spectrum measurement errors are only 0.89 mN/m and 2.4%, respectively, making it useful to identify the contamination duration, microorganism content and microorganism composition. These two data points can be used to determine potential issues with liquor quality when the liquor becomes health-threatening or even just contaminated, with an accuracy of 97.5%.},

abstract = {Accurate tracking of the hands and fingers allows users to employ natural gestures in various interactive applications. Hand tracking also supports health applications, such as monitoring face-touching, a common vector for infectious disease. However, for both types of applications, the utility of hand tracking is often limited by the impracticality of bulky tethered systems (e.g., instrumented gloves) or inherent limitations (e.g., Line of Sight or privacy concerns with vision-based systems). These limitations have severely restricted the adoption of hand tracking in real-world applications. We present MagX, a fully untethered on-body hand tracking system utilizing passive magnets and a novel magnetic sensing platform. Since passive magnets require no maintenance, they can be worn on the hands indefinitely, and only the sensor board needs recharging, akin to a smartwatch.We used MagX to conduct a series of experiments, finding a wearable sensing array can achieve millimeter-accurate 5 DoF tracking of two magnets independently. For example, at 11 cm distance, a 6cm \texttimes{} 6cm sensing array can achieve positional and orientational errors of 0.76 cm and 0.11 rad. At 21 cm distance, the tracking errors are 2.65 cm and 0.41 rad. MagX can leverage larger sensor arrays for improved long-distance tracking, e.g., a 9.8cm \texttimes{} 9.8cm array can achieve 2.62 cm and 0.55 rad tracking performance on two magnets at 27 cm distance. The robust performance can facilitate ubiquitous adoption of magnetic tracking in various applications. Finally, MagX can perform all compute locally and only requires 0.38W total (220mW on the sensor platform plus 159mW on the computing unit) to perform real-time tracking, offering "all day" fully untethered operation on a typical smartwatch-sized battery.},

abstract = {In-air gesture control extends a touch screen and enables contact-less interaction, thus has become a popular research direction in the past few years. Prior work has implemented this functionality based on cameras, acoustic signals, and Wi-Fi via existing hardware on commercial devices. However, these methods have low user acceptance. Solutions based on cameras and acoustic signals raise privacy concerns, while WiFi-based solutions are vulnerable to background noise. As a result, these methods are not commercialized and recent flagship smartphones have implemented in-air gesture recognition by adding extra hardware on-board, such as mmWave radar and depth camera. The question is, can we support in-air gesture control on legacy devices without any hardware modifications?To answer this question, in this work, we propose SMART, an in-air gesture recognition system leveraging the screen and ambient light sensor (ALS), which are ordinary modalities on mobile devices. For the transmitter side, we design a screen display mechanism to embed spatial information and preserve the viewing experience; for the receiver side, we develop a framework to recognize gestures from low-quality ALS readings. We implement and evaluate SMART on both a tablet and several smartphones. Results show that SMART can recognize 9 types of frequently used in-air gestures with an average accuracy of 96.1%.},

abstract = {Recognition of human-object interactions is practically important in various human-centric sensing scenarios such as smart supermarket, factory, and home. This paper proposes an RF-Camera system by fusing RFID and Computer Vision (CV) techniques, which is the first work to recognize the human gestural interactions with physical objects in multi-subject and multi-object scenarios. In RF-Camera, we first propose a dimension reduction method to transform the subject's 3D hand trajectory captured by depth camera to a 2D image, using which the subject's gesture can be recognized. We also propose a method to extract the facial image of target subject from an image that may contain irrelevant subjects, thereby further recognizing his/her identity. Finally, we model the physical movements of the held object's tag and further predict the tag phase data, by comparing which with real phase data of each tag human-object matching can be discovered. When implementing RF-Camera, three technical challenges need to be addressed. (i) To remove noisy data corresponding to irrelevant actions from raw sensing data, we propose a state transition diagram to determine the boundary of effective data. (ii) To predict phase data of the held target tag with unknown hand-tag offset, we quantify target tag trajectory by adding a variable hand-tag vector to captured hand trajectory. (iii) To ensure high reading rates of target tags in tag-dense scenarios, we propose a CV-assisted RFID scheduling method, in which analytics on CV data can help schedule RFID readings. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of RF-Camera. Experimental results demonstrate that RF-Camera can recognize the gestural actions, human identity and human-object matching with an average accuracy higher than 90% in most cases.},

abstract = {Wireless sensing builds upon machine learning shows encouraging results. However, adopting wireless sensing as a large-scale solution remains challenging as experiences from deployments have shown the performance of a machine-learned model to suffer when there are changes in the environment, e.g., when furniture is moved or when other objects are added or removed from the environment. We present Rise, a novel solution for enhancing the robustness and performance of learning-based wireless sensing techniques against such changes during a deployment. Rise combines probability and statistical assessments together with anomaly detection to identify samples that are likely to be misclassified and uses feedback on these samples to update a deployed wireless sensing model. We validate Rise through extensive empirical benchmarks by considering 11 representative sensing methods covering a broad range of wireless sensing tasks. Our results show that Rise can identify 92.3% of misclassifications on average. We showcase how Rise can be combined with incremental learning to help wireless sensing models retain their performance against dynamic changes in the operating environment to reduce the maintenance cost, paving the way for learning-based wireless sensing to become capable of supporting long-term monitoring in complex everyday environments.},

abstract = {Being able to see into walls is crucial for diagnostics of building health; it enables inspections of wall structure without undermining the structural integrity. However, existing sensing devices do not seem to offer a full capability in mapping the in-wall structure while identifying their status (e.g., seepage and corrosion). In this paper, we design and implement SiWa as a low-cost and portable system for wall inspections. Built upon a customized IR-UWB radar, SiWa scans a wall as a user swipes its probe along the wall surface; it then analyzes the reflected signals to synthesize an image and also to identify the material status. Although conventional schemes exist to handle these problems individually, they require troublesome calibrations that largely prevent them from practical adoptions. To this end, we equip SiWa with a deep learning pipeline to parse the rich sensory data. With innovative construction and training, the deep learning modules perform structural imaging and the subsequent analysis on material status, without the need for repetitive parameter tuning and calibrations. We build SiWa as a prototype and evaluate its performance via extensive experiments and field studies; results evidently confirm that SiWa accurately maps in-wall structures, identifies their materials, and detects possible defects, suggesting a promising solution for diagnosing building health with minimal effort and cost.},

Given the wide-spreading, steady diffusion of ear-worn wearables (Earables) as the new frontier of wearable devices, we investigate the feasibility of earable-based gait identification. Specifically, we look at gait-based identification from the sounds induced by walking and propagated through the musculoskeletal system in the body. Our system, EarGate, leverages an in-ear facing microphone which exploits the earable's occlusion effect to reliably detect the user's gait from inside the ear canal, without impairing the general usage of earphones. With data collected from 31 subjects, we show that EarGate achieves up to 97.26% Balanced Accuracy (BAC) with very low False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 3.23% and 2.25%, respectively. Further, our measurement of power consumption and latency investigates how this gait identification model could live both as a stand-alone or cloud-coupled earable system.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, facial landmark tracking and 3D reconstruction have gained considerable attention due to their numerous applications such as human-computer interactions, facial expression analysis, and emotion recognition, etc. Traditional approaches require users to be confined to a particular location and face a camera under constrained recording conditions (e.g., without occlusions and under good lighting conditions). This highly restricted setting prevents them from being deployed in many application scenarios involving human motions. In this paper, we propose the first single-earpiece lightweight biosensing system, BioFace-3D, that can unobtrusively, continuously, and reliably sense the entire facial movements, track 2D facial landmarks, and further render 3D facial animations. Our single-earpiece biosensing system takes advantage of the cross-modal transfer learning model to transfer the knowledge embodied in a high-grade visual facial landmark detection model to the low-grade biosignal domain. After training, our BioFace-3D can directly perform continuous 3D facial reconstruction from the biosignals, without any visual input. Without requiring a camera positioned in front of the user, this paradigm shift from visual sensing to biosensing would introduce new opportunities in many emerging mobile and IoT applications. Extensive experiments involving 16 participants under various settings demonstrate that BioFace-3D can accurately track 53 major facial landmarks with only 1.85 mm average error and 3.38% normalized mean error, which is comparable with most state-of-the-art camera-based solutions. The rendered 3D facial animations, which are in consistency with the real human facial movements, also validate the system's capability in continuous 3D facial reconstruction.},

abstract = {A long-standing challenge in radios for wearables is to design ultra-low power, yet high performance receivers with good sensitivity and spectral efficiency while being compatible with WiFi. The vanilla envelope detector used in standard UHF RFID is the most popular receivers on backscatter tags since they are passive but suffer from poor sensitivity and cannot decode complex modulations, which makes them a poor choice for directly decoding data from WiFi packets.In this paper, we present the design of an easy-to-prototype ultra-low power WiFi receiver called MIXIQ that operates at μWs of power while providing improved sensitivity and decode-ability of complex high-rate signals. MIXIQ uses the signaling capabilities of the newest standard of WiFi, 802.11ax, to turn a standard WiFi packet into a helper + data signal. The same non-linear RF circuit used in a vanilla envelope detector, when driven by this twin signal, now behaves like a passive mixer i.e. it down-converts the RF carrier data to the sub-MHz range without adding any energy overhead. MIXIQ then uses an ultra low-power largely digital baseband pipeline to (i) significantly boost sensitivity using ultra low power components; (ii) enable the demodulation of complex signals for substantial boost in spectral efficiency. We show that MIXIQ improves upon the vanilla envelope detector by 25dB in sensitivity and 89\texttimes{} in bandwidth efficiency, while consuming 0.3mW for a PCB-based implementation and 40μW for CMOS simulation. We also demonstrate a Hearable system that leverages MIXIQ to improve VOIP reception range by 10\texttimes{} compared to a vanilla envelope detector.},

abstract = {Arterial blood pressure (ABP) monitoring using wearables has emerged as a promising approach to empower users with self-monitoring for effective diagnosis and control of hypertension. However, existing schemes mainly monitor ABP at discrete time intervals, involve some form of user effort, have insufficient accuracy, and require collecting sufficient training data for model development. To tackle these problems, we propose Crisp-BP, a novel ABP monitoring system leveraging the PPG sensor available in commercial wrist-worn devices (e.g., smartwatches or fitness trackers). It enables continuous, accurate, user-independent ABP monitoring and requires no behavior changes during collecting PPG data. The basic idea is to illuminate a skin/tissue, measure the light absorption, and characterize ABP-related blood volume change in the artery. To obtain accurate measurements and relieve the pain of training data collection, we use an arterial pulse extraction method that removes interference caused by capillary pulses. Moreover, we design a contact pressure estimation method to combat the deficiency of PPG waveform being sensitive to the contact pressure between the sensor and the skin. In addition, we leverage the great power of Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory and design a hybrid neural network model to enable user-independent ABP monitoring, so that users do not have to provide training data for model development. Furthermore, we propose a transfer learning method that first extracts general knowledge from online PPG data, then use it to improve the learning of a new model on our target problem. Extensive experiments with 35 participants demonstrate that Crisp-BP obtains the average estimation error of 0.86 mmHg and 1.67 mmHg and the standard deviation error of 6.55 mmHg and 7.31 mmHg for diastolic pressure and systolic pressure, respectively. These errors are within the acceptable range regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows average errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg. Our results demonstrate that Crisp-BP is promising for improving the diagnosis and control of hypertension as it provides continuousness, comfort, convenience, and accuracy.},

abstract = {Vital signs are crucial indicators for human health, and researchers are studying contact-free alternatives to existing wearable vital signs sensors. Unfortunately, most of these designs demand a subject human body to be relatively static, rendering them very inconvenient to adopt in practice where body movements occur frequently. In particular, radio-frequency (RF) based contact-free sensing can be severely affected by body movements that overwhelm vital signs. To this end, we introduce MoVi-Fi as a motion-robust vital signs monitoring system, capable of recovering fine-grained vital signs waveform in a contact-free manner. Being a pure software system, MoVi-Fi can be built on top of virtually any commercial-grade radars. What inspires our design is that RF reflections caused by vital signs, albeit weak, do not totally disappear but are composited with other motion-incurred reflections in a nonlinear manner. As nonlinear blind source separation is inherently hard, MoVi-Fi innovatively employs deep contrastive learning to tackle the problem; this self-supervised method requires no ground truth in training, and it exploits contrastive signal features to distinguish vital signs from body movements. Our experiments with 12 subjects and 80hour data demonstrate that MoVi-Fi accurately recovers vital signs waveform under severe body movements.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become ubiquitous techniques in mobile and embedded systems for applications such as image/object recognition and classification. The trend of executing multiple DNNs simultaneously exacerbate the existing limitations of meeting stringent latency/accuracy requirements on resource constrained mobile devices. The prior art sheds light on exploring the accuracy-resource tradeoff by scaling the model sizes in accordance to resource dynamics. However, such model scaling approaches face to imminent challenges: (i) large space exploration of model sizes, and (ii) prohibitively long training time for different model combinations. In this paper, we present LegoDNN, a lightweight, block-grained scaling solution for running multi-DNN workloads in mobile vision systems. LegoDNN guarantees short model training times by only extracting and training a small number of common blocks (e.g. 5 in VGG and 8 in ResNet) in a DNN. At run-time, LegoDNN optimally combines the descendant models of these blocks to maximize accuracy under specific resources and latency constraints, while reducing switching overhead via smart block-level scaling of the DNN. We implement LegoDNN in TensorFlow Lite and extensively evaluate it against state-of-the-art techniques (FLOP scaling, knowledge distillation and model compression) using a set of 12 popular DNN models. Evaluation results show that LegoDNN provides 1,296x to 279,936x more options in model sizes without increasing training time, thus achieving as much as 31.74% improvement in inference accuracy and 71.07% reduction in scaling energy consumptions.},

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has been a popular method to achieve distributed machine learning among numerous devices without sharing their data to a cloud server. FL aims to learn a shared global model with the participation of massive devices under the orchestration of a central server. However, mobile devices usually have limited communication bandwidth to transfer local updates to the central server. In addition, the data residing across devices is intrinsically statistically heterogeneous (i.e., non-IID data distribution). Learning a single global model may not work well for all devices participating in the FL under data heterogeneity. Such communication cost and data heterogeneity are two critical bottlenecks that hinder from applying FL in practice. Moreover, mobile devices usually have limited computational resources. Improving the inference efficiency of the learned model is critical to deploy deep learning applications on mobile devices. In this paper, we present Hermes - a communication and inference-efficient FL framework under data heterogeneity. To this end, each device finds a small subnetwork by applying the structured pruning; only the updates of these subnetworks will be communicated between the server and the devices. Instead of taking the average over all parameters of all devices as conventional FL frameworks, the server performs the average on only overlapped parameters across each subnetwork. By applying Hermes, each device can learn a personalized and structured sparse deep neural network, which can run efficiently on devices. Experiment results show the remarkable advantages of Hermes over the status quo approaches. Hermes achieves as high as 32.17% increase in inference accuracy, 3.48\texttimes{} reduction on the communication cost, 1.83\texttimes{} speedup in inference efficiency, and 1.8\texttimes{} savings on energy consumption.},

Such cellular IoT services share the existing cellular network architecture with non-IoT (e.g., smartphone) ones. When they are newly integrated into the cellular network, new security vulnerabilities may happen from imprudent integration. In this work, we explore the security vulnerabilities of the cellular IoT from both system-integrated and service-integrated aspects. We discover five vulnerabilities spanning cellular standard design defects, network operation slips, and IoT device implementation flaws. Threateningly, they allow an adversary to remotely identify IP addresses and phone numbers assigned to cellular IoT devices and launch data/text spamming attacks against them. We experimentally validate these vulnerabilities and attacks with three major U.S. IoT carriers. The attack evaluation result shows that the adversary can raise an IoT data bill by up to $226 with less than 120 MB spam traffic and increase an IoT text bill at a rate of $5 per second; moreover, cellular IoT devices may suffer from denial of IoT services. We finally propose, prototype, and evaluate recommended solutions.},

abstract = {The SIM/eSIM card stores critical information for a mobile user to access the 4G/5G network. In this work, we uncover three vulnerabilities of the current SIM practice. We show that the PIN-based access control may expose the in-SIM data to an adversary through both hardware and software. Once exposed, such in-SIM information can be used to reconstruct various keys used for device authentication, data encryption, etc. They thus enable a number of attacks, including traffic eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attack, impersonation, etc. The fundamental problem is that, the current SIM design does not offer proper authentication and fine-grained access control to hundreds of in-SIM files for various in-card applets and off-card units. We next propose a new solution that offers both authentication and fine-grained access control. Our implementation and evaluation have confirmed the viability of our proposal.},

abstract = {Augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) has extended beyond 3D immersive gaming to a broader array of applications, such as shopping, tourism, education. And recently there has been a large shift from handheld-controller dominated interactions to headset-dominated interactions via voice interfaces. In this work, we show a serious privacy risk of using voice interfaces while the user is wearing the face-mounted AR/VR devices. Specifically, we design an eavesdropping attack, Face-Mic, which leverages speech-associated subtle facial dynamics captured by zero-permission motion sensors in AR/VR headsets to infer highly sensitive information from live human speech, including speaker gender, identity, and speech content. Face-Mic is grounded on a key insight that AR/VR headsets are closely mounted on the user's face, allowing a potentially malicious app on the headset to capture underlying facial dynamics as the wearer speaks, including movements of facial muscles and bone-borne vibrations, which encode private biometrics and speech characteristics. To mitigate the impacts of body movements, we develop a signal source separation technique to identify and separate the speech-associated facial dynamics from other types of body movements. We further extract representative features with respect to the two types of facial dynamics. We successfully demonstrate the privacy leakage through AR/VR headsets by deriving the user's gender/identity and extracting speech information via the development of a deep learning-based framework. Extensive experiments using four mainstream VR headsets validate the generalizability, effectiveness, and high accuracy of Face-Mic.},

We show that media sounds, such as the melodies of notification tones (e.g., iPhone message and Samsung whistle) can be directly used to sense and verify the user's gripping hand. Because sounds and vibrations co-exist, we capture two novel responses via the smartphone mic and accelerometer to describe how the individual's contacting palm interferes with the signals in two different domains. Based on the two responses, we develop a convolutional neural network-based algorithm to verify the user. Moreover, because the smartphone sensors are all embedded on the same motherboard, we develop a cross-domain method to validate such hard-to-forge physical relationships among the mic, speaker and accelerometer. They prevent external sounds from cheating the system. Additionally, we consider the notification vibration as a special type of media sound, which also results in two responses, and extend our method to work in the silent mode. Extensive experiments with ten notification tones and four phone models show that our system verifies users with 95% accuracy and prevents replay sounds with 100% accuracy.},

abstract = {Each fall, millions of monarch butterflies across the northern US and Canada migrate up to 4,000 km to overwinter in the exact same cluster of mountain peaks in central Mexico. To track monarchs precisely and study their navigation, a monarch tracker must obtain daily localization of the butterfly as it progresses on its 3-month journey. And, the tracker must perform this task while having a weight in the tens of milligram (mg) and measuring a few millimeters (mm) in size to avoid interfering with monarch's flight. This paper proposes mSAIL, 8 \texttimes{} 8 \texttimes{} 2.6 mm and 62 mg embedded system for monarch migration tracking, constructed using 8 prior custom-designed ICs providing solar energy harvesting, an ultra-low power processor, light/temperature sensors, power management, and a wireless transceiver, all integrated and 3D stacked on a micro PCB with an 8 \texttimes{} 8 mm printed antenna. The proposed system is designed to record and compress light and temperature data during the migration path while harvesting solar energy for energy autonomy, and wirelessly transmit the data at the overwintering site in Mexico, from which the daily location of the butterfly can be estimated using a deep learning-based localization algorithm. A 2-day trial experiment of mSAIL attached on a live butterfly in an outdoor botanical garden demonstrates the feasibility of individual butterfly localization and tracking.},

Navigation systems for such environments need to strike a balance between price and precision. In this paper, we propose magnetic vehicular positioning (MVP), a navigation system that guides drivers in GNSS-denied environments. The key idea of MVP is to extract magnetic fingerprints from geomagnetic field anomalies. By comparing the measured magnetic field against a magnetic map, positioning can be achieved without GNSS signals. Our proposed matching algorithm allows MVP to provide 5.14 m positioning accuracy. We conducted large-scale real-road experiments for 36 months in two countries and 56 tunnels to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. Because MVP can be deployed on off-the-shelf smartphones, our approach makes accurate navigation in GNSS-denied environments affordable.},

abstract = {Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) heavily rely on 3D sensors such as LiDARs, radars, and stereo cameras. However, 3D sensors from a single vehicle suffer from two fundamental limitations: vulnerability to occlusion and loss of details on far-away objects. To overcome both limitations, in this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate EMP, a novel edge-assisted multi-vehicle perception system for CAVs. In EMP, multiple nearby CAVs share their raw sensor data with an edge server which then merges CAVs' individual views to form a more complete view with a higher resolution. The merged view can drastically enhance the perception quality of the participating CAVs. Our core methodological contribution is to make the sensor data sharing scalable, adaptive, and resource-efficient over oftentimes highly fluctuating wireless links through a series of novel algorithms, which are then integrated into a full-fledged cooperative sensing pipeline. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that EMP can achieve real-time processing at 24 FPS and end-to-end latency of 93 ms on average. EMP reduces the end-to-end latency by 49% to 65% compared to the traditional vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) sharing approach without edge support. Our case studies show that cooperative sensing powered by EMP can detect hazards such as blind spots faster by 0.5 to 1.1 seconds, compared to a single vehicle's perception.},

abstract = {Object detection is a fundamental building block of video analytics applications. While Neural Networks (NNs)-based object detection models have shown excellent accuracy on benchmark datasets, they are not well positioned for high-resolution images inference on resource-constrained edge devices. Common approaches, including down-sampling inputs and scaling up neural networks, fall short of adapting to video content changes and various latency requirements. This paper presents Remix, a flexible framework for high-resolution object detection on edge devices. Remix takes as input a latency budget, and come up with an image partition and model execution plan which runs off-the-shelf neural networks on non-uniformly partitioned image blocks. As a result, it maximizes the overall detection accuracy by allocating various amount of compute power onto different areas of an image. We evaluate Remix on public dataset as well as real-world videos collected by ourselves. Experimental results show that Remix can either improve the detection accuracy by 18%-120% for a given latency budget, or achieve up to 8.1\texttimes{} inference speedup with accuracy on par with the state-of-the-art NNs.},

abstract = {Infrastructure-assisted autonomous driving is an emerging paradigm that aims to make affordable autonomous vehicles a reality. A key technology for realizing this vision is real-time point cloud registration which allows a vehicle to fuse the 3D point clouds generated by its own LiDAR and those on roadside infrastructures such as smart lampposts, which can deliver increased sensing range, more robust object detection, and centimeter-level navigation. Unfortunately, the existing methods for point cloud registration assume two clouds to share a similar perspective and large overlap, which result in significant delay and inaccuracy in real-world infrastructure-assisted driving settings. This paper proposes VI-Eye - the first system that can align vehicle-infrastructure point clouds at centimeter accuracy in real-time. Our key idea is to exploit traffic domain knowledge by detecting a set of key semantic objects including road, lane lines, curbs, and traffic signs. Based on the inherent regular geometries of such semantic objects, VI-Eye extracts a small number of saliency points and leverage them to achieve real-time registration of two point clouds. By allowing vehicles and infrastructures to extract the semantic information in parallel, VI-Eye leads to a highly scalable architecture for infrastructure-assisted autonomous driving. To evaluate the performance of VI-Eye, we collect two new multiview LiDAR point cloud datasets on an indoor autonomous driving testbed and a campus smart lamppost testbed, respectively. They contain total 915 point cloud pairs and cover three roads of 1.12km. Experiment results show that VI-Eye achieves centimeter-level accuracy within around 0.2s, and delivers a 5X improvement in accuracy and 2X speedup over state-of-the-art baselines.},

The metasurface consists of many unit-cells, each acting as a phase shifter for signals going through it. By encoding the phase shifting values, RFlens can manipulate electromagnetic waves to "reshape" and resteer the beam pattern. We prototype RFlens for 5 GHz Wi-Fi signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RFlens can achieve a 4.6 dB median signal strength improvement (up to 9.3 dB) even with a relatively small 16 \texttimes{} 16 array of unit-cells. In addition, RFlens can effectively improve the secrecy capacity of IoT links and enable passive NLoS wireless sensing applications.},

abstract = {Radio frequency (RF) technologies have achieved a great success in data communication. In recent years, pervasive RF signals are further exploited for sensing; RF sensing has since attracted attentions from both academia and industry. Existing developments mainly employ commodity Wi-Fi hardware or rely on sophisticated SDR platforms. While promising in many aspects, there still remains a gap between lab prototypes and real-life deployments. On one hand, due to its narrow bandwidth and communication-oriented design, Wi-Fi sensing offers a coarse sensing granularity and its performance is very unstable in harsh real-world environments. On the other hand, SDR-based designs may hardly be adopted in practice due to its large size and high cost. To this end, we propose, design, and implement Octopus, a compact and flexible wideband MIMO sensing platform, built using commercial-grade low-power impulse radio. Octopus provides a standalone and fully programmable RF sensing solution; it allows for quick algorithm design and application development, and it specifically leverages the wideband radio to achieve a competent and robust performance in practice. We evaluate the performance of Octopus via micro-benchmarking, and further demonstrate its applicability using representative RF sensing applications, including passive localization, vibration sensing, and human/object imaging.},

abstract = {Visible Light Communication (VLC) is considered a new paradigm for next-generation wireless communication. Recently, studies show that during the process of VLC transmission, besides the visible light signals, the transmitter also leaks out RF signals through a side channel. What is interesting is that the data transmitted in the VLC channel can be inferred from the leaked RF signals. Fundamentally, it means the leaked RF signals carry a copy of the same data in the VLC channel. In this work, we show for the first time that besides inferring the original VLC data, the leaked side channel can be smartly leveraged to carry new data, significantly increasing the data rate of current VLC systems. To realize this objective, we propose a system named RadioInLight, with designs spanning across hardware and software. Without any dedicated active RF transmission front-end which consumes power and hardware resources, RadioInLight is able to double the data rate of the VLC system by purely manipulating the free passively leaked RF signals without affecting the data rate of the original VLC transmissions.},

However, for real-world MIMO deployments, estimating the downlink wireless channel from each antenna on the base station to every client device is a critical bottleneck, especially for the widely used frequency duplexed designs that cannot utilize reciprocity. Typically, this channel estimation requires explicit feedback from client devices and is prohibitive for large antenna deployments. In this paper, we present FIRE, a system that uses an end-to-end machine learning approach to enable accurate channel estimation without requiring any feedback from client devices. FIRE is interpretable, accurate, and has low compute overhead. We show that FIRE can successfully support MIMO transmissions in a real-world testbed and achieves SNR improvement over 10 dB in MIMO transmissions compared to the current state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {LoRa, as a representative Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technology, can provide long-range communication for battery-powered IoT devices with a 10-year lifetime. LoRa links in practice, however, experience high dynamics in various environments. When the SNR falls below the threshold (e.g., in the building), a LoRa device disconnects from the network. We propose Falcon, which addresses the link dynamics by enabling data transmission for very low SNR or even disconnected LoRa links. At the heart of Falcon, we reveal that low SNR LoRa links that cannot deliver packets can still introduce interference to other LoRa transmissions. Therefore, Falcon transmits data bits on the low SNR link by selectively interfering with other LoRa transmissions. We address practical challenges in Falcon design. We propose a low-power channel activity detection method to detect other LoRa transmissions for selective interference. To interfere with the so-called interference-resilient LoRa, we accurately estimate the time and frequency offsets on LoRa packets and propose an adaptive frequency adjusting strategy to maximize the interference. We implement Falcon, all using commercial off-the-shelf LoRa devices, and extensively evaluate its performance. The results show that Falcon can provide reliable communication links for disconnected LoRa devices and achieves the SNR boundary upto 7.5 dB lower than that of standard LoRa.},

abstract = {Localization is important for a large number of Internet of Things (IoT) endpoint devices connected by LoRaWAN. Due to the bandwidth limitations of LoRaWAN, existing localization methods without specialized hardware (e.g., GPS) produce poor performance. To increase the localization accuracy, we propose a super-resolution localization method, called Seirios, which features a novel algorithm to synchronize multiple non-overlapped communication channels by exploiting the unique features of the radio physical layer to increase the overall bandwidth. By exploiting both the original and the conjugate of the physical layer, Seirios can resolve the direct path from multiple reflectors in both indoor and outdoor environments. We design a Seirios prototype and evaluate its performance in an outdoor area of 100 m \texttimes{} 60 m, and an indoor area of 25 m \texttimes{} 15 m, which shows that Seirios can achieve a median error of 4.4 m outdoors (80% samples &lt; 6.4 m), and 2.4 m indoors (80% samples &lt; 6.1 m), respectively. The results show that Seirios produces 42% less localization error than the baseline approach. Our evaluation also shows that, different to previous studies in Wi-Fi localization systems that have wider bandwidth, time-of-fight (ToF) estimation is less effective for LoRaWAN localization systems with narrowband radio signals.},

The key enabling technology behind PCube is a novel air-channel phase measurement technique which is able to extract phase differences of air-channels between LoRa nodes and multiple antennas of a gateway. PCube leverages the reception diversities of multiple receiving antennas of a gateway and scales the concurrent transmissions of a large number of LoRa nodes, even exceeding the number of receiving antennas at a gateway. As a phase-based parallel decoder, PCube provides a new dimension to resolve collisions and supports more concurrent transmissions by complementing time and frequency based parallel decoders. PCube is implemented and evaluated with synchronized software defined radios and off-the-shelf LoRa nodes in both indoors and outdoors. Results demonstrate that PCube can substantially outperform state-of-the-art works in terms of aggregated throughput by 4.9\texttimes{} and the number of concurrent nodes by up to 5\texttimes{}. More importantly, PCube scales well with the number of receiving antennas of a gateway, which is promising to break the barrier of concurrent transmissions.},

abstract = {LoRa backscatter is a promising technology to achieve low-power and long-distance communication for connecting millions of devices in the Internet of Things. We present P2LoRa, the first ambient LoRa backscatter system with parallel decoding and long-range communication. The high level idea of P2LoRa is to modulate data by shifting ambient LoRa packets with a small frequency. To achieve long distance communication, we enhance the SNR of the backscatter signal by concentrating leaked energy in both the frequency domain and time domain. We propose a method to accurately reconstruct and cancel the in-band excitation signal, which is orders of magnitude higher than the backscatter signal. For parallel decoding, we propose a method to cancel inter-tag interference with very low overhead and address the signal misalignment problem due to different time of flight. We prototype the P2LoRa tag with customized low-cost hardware and implement the P2LoRa gateway on USRP. Through extensive evaluations, we show that P2LoRa achieves a long communication distance of 2.2 km with ambient LoRa, and supports 101 parallel tag transmissions.},

abstract = {Light bulbs have been recently explored to design Light Fidelity (LiFi) communication to battery-free tags, thus complementing Radiofrequency (RF) backscatter in the uplink. In this paper, we show that LiFi and RF backscatter are complementary and have unexplored interactions. We introduce PassiveLiFi, a battery-free system that uses LiFi to transmit RF backscatter at a meagre power budget. We address several challenges on the system design in the LiFi transmitter, the tag and the RF receiver. We design the first LiFi transmitter that implements a chirp spread spectrum (CSS) using the visible light spectrum. We use a small bank of solar cells for communication and harvesting and reconfigure them based on the amount of harvested energy and desired data rate. We further alleviate the low responsiveness of solar cells with a new low-power receiver design in the tag. Experimental results with an RF carrier of 17 dBm show that we can generate RF backscatter with a range of 80.3 meters/μW consumed in the tag, which is almost double with respect to prior work.},

abstract = {Modern acoustic wearables with microphone arrays are promising to offer rich experience (e.g., 360° sound and acoustic imaging) to consumers. Realtime multi-track audio streaming with precise synchronization however poses significant challenges to the existing wireless microphone array designs that depend on complex digital synchronization as well as bulky and power-hungry hardware.This paper presents a novel microphone array sensor architecture that enables synchronous concurrent transmission of multitrack audio signals using analog backscatter communication. We develop novel Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) and Differential Pulse Position Modulation (DPPM) baseband circuits that can generate a spectral-efficient, time-multiplexing, and multi-track-synchronous baseband signal for backscattering. Its lightweight analog synchronization supports parallel multimedia signals without using any ADCs, DSPs, codecs and RF transceivers, hence largely reducing the complexity, latency, and power consumption. To further enhance self-sustainability, we also design an energy harvester that can extract energy from both sound and RF. We have built a microphone array backscatter sensor prototype using an FPGA, discrete components, and analog devices. Our experiments demonstrate a communication range (sensor-to-reader) of up to 28 meters for 8 audio tracks, and an equivalent throughput of up to 6.4 Mbps with a sample rate over 48KHz. Our sensor achieves 87.4μs of streaming latency for 4 tracks, which is 650x improvement as compared with digital solutions. ASIC design results show that it consumes as low as 175.2μW of power. Three sample applications including an acoustic imaging system, a beamform filter, and a voice control system, all built with our phased-array microphone, further demonstrate the applicability of our design.},

abstract = {5G networks are gaining pace in development and deployment in recent years. One of 5G's key objective is to support a variety of use cases with different Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Slicing is a key part of 5G that allows operators to provide a tailored set of resources to different use cases in order to meet their SLOs. Existing works focus on slicing in the frontend or the C-RAN. However, slicing is missing in the fronthaul network that connects the frontend to the C-RAN. This leads to over-provisioning in the fronthaul and the C-RAN, and also limits the scalability of the network.In this paper, we design and implement Fronthaul Slicing Architecture (FSA), which to the best of our knowledge, is the first slicing architecture for the fronthaul network. FSA runs in the switch dataplane and uses information from the wireless schedule to identify the slice of a fronthaul data packet at line-rate. It enables multipoint-to-multipoint routing as well as packet prioritization to provide multiplexing gains in the fronthaul and the C-RAN, making the system more scalable. Our testbed evaluation using scaled-up LTE traces shows that FSA can support accurate multipoint-to-multipoint routing for 80 Gbps of fronthaul traffic. Further, the slice-aware packet scheduling enabled by FSA's packet prioritization reduces the 95th percentile Flowlet Completion Times (FCT) of latency-sensitive traffic by up to 4 times.},

abstract = {Given the wide interest on mobile core systems and their pivotal role in the operations of current and future mobile network services, we focus on the issue of their effective evaluation, considering the radio access network (RAN) emulation methodology. While there exist a number of different RAN emulators, following different paradigms, they are limited in their scalability and flexibility, and moreover there is no one commonly accepted RAN emulator. Motivated by this, we present Nervion, a scalable and flexible RAN emulator for mobile core system evaluation that takes a novel cloud-native approach. Nervion embeds innovations to enable scalability via abstractions and RAN element containerization, and additionally supports an even more scalable control-plane only mode. It also offers ample flexibility in terms of realizing arbitrary RAN emulation scenarios, mapping them to compute clusters, and evaluating diverse core system designs. We develop a prototype implementation of Nervion that supports 4G and 5G standard compliant RAN emulation and integrate it into the Powder platform to benefit the research community. Our experimental evaluations validate its correctness and demonstrate its scalability relative to representative set of existing RAN emulators. We also present multiple case studies using Nervion that highlight its flexibility to support diverse types of mobile core evaluations.},

abstract = {RAN virtualization will become a key technology for the last mile of next-generation mobile networks driven by initiatives such as the O-RAN alliance. However, due to the computing fluctuations inherent to wireless dynamics and resource contention in shared computing infrastructure, the price to migrate from dedicated to shared platforms may be too high. Indeed, we show in this paper that the baseline architecture of a base station's distributed unit (DU) collapses upon moments of deficit in computing capacity. Recent solutions to accelerate some signal processing tasks certainly help but do not tackle the core problem: a DU pipeline that requires predictable computing to provide carrier-grade reliability.We present Nuberu, a novel pipeline architecture for 4G/5G DUs specifically engineered for non-deterministic computing platforms. Our design has one key objective to attain reliability: to guarantee a minimum set of signals that preserve synchronization between the DU and its users during computing capacity shortages and, provided this, maximize network throughput. To this end, we use techniques such as tight deadline control, jitter-absorbing buffers, predictive HARQ, and congestion control. Using an experimental prototype, we show that Nuberu attains &gt;95% of the theoretical spectrum efficiency in hostile environments, where state-of-art approaches lose connectivity, and at least 80% resource savings.},

abstract = {Being able to use a single app across multiple devices can bring novel experiences to the users in various domains including entertainment and productivity. For instance, a user of a video editing app would be able to use a smart pad as a canvas and a smartphone as a remote toolbox so that the toolbox does not occlude the canvas during editing. However, existing approaches do not properly support the single-app multi-device execution due to several limitations, including high development cost, device heterogeneity, and high performance requirement. In this paper, we introduce FLUID-XP, a novel cross-platform multi-device system that enables UIs of a single app to be executed across heterogeneous platforms, while overcoming the limitations of previous approaches. FLUID-XP provides flexible, efficient, and seamless interactions by addressing three main challenges: i) how to transparently enable a single-display app to use multiple displays, ii) how to distribute UIs across heterogeneous devices with minimal network traffic, and iii) how to optimize the UI distribution process when multiple UIs have different distribution requirements. Our experiments with a working prototype of FLUID-XP on Android confirm that FLUID-XP successfully supports a variety of unmodified real-world apps across heterogeneous platforms (Android, iOS, and Linux). We also conduct a lab study with 25 participants to demonstrate the effectiveness of FLUID-XP with real users.},

abstract = {Maximizing the quality of experience (QoE) for real-time video is a long-standing challenge. Traditional video transport protocols, represented by a few deterministic rules, can hardly adapt to the heterogeneous and highly dynamic modern Internet. Emerging learning-based algorithms have demonstrated potential to meet the challenge. However, our measurement study reveals an alarming long tail performance issue: these algorithms tend to be bottle-necked by occasional catastrophic events due to the built-in exploration mechanisms. In this work, we propose Loki, which improves the robustness of learning-based model by coherently integrating it with a rule-based algorithm. To enable integration at feature level, we first reverse-engineer the rule-based algorithm into an equivalent "black-box" neural network. Then, we design a dual-attention feature fusion mechanism to fuse it with a reinforcement learning model. We train Loki in a commercial real-time video system through online learning, and evaluate it over 101 million video sessions, in comparison to state-of-the-art rule-based and learning-based solutions. The results show that Loki improves not only the average but also the tail performance substantially (26.30% to 44.24% reduction of stall rate and 1.76% to 2.17% increase in video throughput at 95-percentile).},

Today, there is an unmet need in providing such analytics in an interactive manner, especially over weak Internet connections, to quickly diagnose and solve problems in the commercial industry space of monitoring assets using drones in remote parts of the world. Existing mechanisms either compromise on the quality of insights by not building 3D images and analyze individual 2D images in isolation, or spend tens of minutes building a 3D image before obtaining and uploading insights. We present Visage, a system that accelerates 3D image analytics by identifying smaller parts of the data that can actually benefit from 3D analytics and prioritizing building, and uploading the localized 3D images for those parts. To achieve this, Visage uses a graph to represent raw 2D images and their relative content overlap, and then identifies the various subgraphs using application knowledge that are good candidates for localized 3D image based insights. We evaluate Visage using data from multiple real deployments and show that it can reduce analytics-latency by up to four orders of magnitude.},

These requirements posed interesting scientific and engineering challenges such as how to accurately estimate battery drain without requiring a priori power modeling, work on unmodified devices, and automatically monitor code evolution to generate high-fidelity battery spike alerts with actionable insights. These requirements motivated a complete overhaul of the eTester design and led to the creation of a novel battery drain testing methodology. We show how the redesigned eTester was used to effortlessly find battery bugs in some of the most popular Android apps with hundreds of millions of users, such as Netflix and CNN. We are open-sourcing eTester to encourage further research in battery diagnosis and to empower developers to write battery-efficient mobile software.},

In this work, we present Winect, a 3D human pose tracking system for free-form activity using commodity WiFi devices. Our system tracks free-form activity by estimating a 3D skeleton pose that consists of a set of joints of the human body. In particular, Winect first identifies the moving limbs by leveraging the signals reflected off the human body and separates the entangled signals for each limb. Then, our system tracks each limb and constructs a 3D skeleton of the body by modeling the inherent relationship between the movements of the limb and the corresponding joints. Our evaluation results show that Winect achieves centimeter-level accuracy for free-form activity tracking under various environments.},

It utilizes an acoustic sensing approach to capture the ear canal deformation with the built-in microphone and speaker of the earables. Specifically, it first emits well-designed inaudible beep signals and records the reflected signals from the ear canal. It then analyzes the reflected signals and extracts fine-grained acoustic features that correspond to the ear canal deformation for user authentication. Our experimental evaluation shows that EarDynamic can achieve a recall of 97.38% and an F1 score of 96.84%.},

To protect the privacy of users' local data, we innovatively introduce the idea of federated learning into the field of wireless sensing, by uploading users' local model parameters instead of their local data. Then, in response to the uneven computing power of different users' edge devices, we propose a local model update algorithm based on adaptive computing power. Furthermore, a client selection algorithm based on test nodes is designed to reduce the negative influence of malicious clients on Co-Sense. Finally, we evaluate Co-Sense on three well-known public wireless datasets, including the gesture dataset, the activity dataset, and the gait dataset. Experimental results show that the sensing accuracy of Co-Sense is more than 10% higher than that of the most advanced wireless sensing models.},

Specifically, the proposed system emits periodic ultrasonic pulses to sense if the phone is being held in hand or placed on support surfaces (e.g., seat and cup holder) by capturing the unique signal interference resulted from the contact object's damping, reflection and refraction. We derive the short-time Fourier transform from the microphone data to describe such impacts and develop a CNN-based binary classifier to discriminate the phone use between the handheld and the handsfree status. Additionally, we design a classification error correction filter to correct the classification errors during the monitoring. The experiments with six people, one phone and one car model show that our system achieves 99% accuracy in recognizing handheld phone-use activities.},

abstract = {In this paper, we design and implement a deep advertising signage system, called DeepAd, with context-aware advertisement and cyber-physical interaction based on Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. In the DeepAd system, instant sensing and diverse interacting features are integrated with an IoT signage, which can (1) transmit multimedia contents and receive specific messages to/from smartphone users, (2) sense and interact with nearby individuals through image sensors, (3) embed context-aware advertisement information in sound waves, and (4) customize the on-screen 3D doll with an audience's face on demand. Through built-in sensors and smartphone interfaces, DeepAd can interact with nearby audiences via real-time multimedia services on the IoT signage in a click-and-drag manner. In addition, DeepAd investigates data-over-sound techniques to send embedded status-related advertisement via background music/voice. Furthermore, DeepAd explores deep learning based face changing and recognition to provide innovative and customized services to smartphone users.

abstract = {This paper studies a fundamental distributed primitive - approximate consensus - in connected things using wireless networks. It has been extensively studied in different disciplines, such as fault-tolerant computing, distributed computing, control, and robotics communities. To our surprise, we have not found any practical algorithm that is appropriate for our target scenario - a system of small things that have limited computation and storage capability, and use lossy wireless links to communicate with each other.This work first identifies the limitations of prior algorithms. Then we present two fault-tolerant approximate consensus algorithms, which minimizes storage complexity. In an n-node system, the first algorithm tolerates crash faults and only needs to store 4 values and an n-bit bit-vector, whereas the second algorithm tolerates up to f Byzantine faults, and needs to store 2f + 4 values and an n-bit bit-vector. In practice, these values are implemented using either integer or float data type. Compared to our algorithms, prior works may need to store O(nD) more values, where D is the number of rounds needed for convergence.},

abstract = {Detection-driven video analytics is resource hungry as it depends on running object detectors on video frames. Running an object detection engine (i.e., deep learning models such as YOLO and EfficientDet) for each frame makes video analytics pipelines difficult to achieve real-time processing. In this paper, we leverage selective processing of frames and batching of frames to reduce the overall cost of running detection models on live videos. We discuss several factors that hinder the real-time processing of detection-driven video analytics. We propose a system with configurable knobs and show how to achieve the stability of the system using a Lyapunov-based control strategy. In our setup, heterogeneous edge devices (e.g. mobile phones, cameras) stream videos to a low-resource edge server where frames are selectively processed in batches and the detection results are sent to the cloud or to the edge device for further application-aware processing. Preliminary results on controlling different knobs, such as frame skipping, frame size, and batch size show interesting insights to achieve real-time processing of multi-stream video streams with low overhead and low overall information loss.},

To enhance transmission efficiency, a user plane function (UPF) with a specific packet processing mechanism is necessary. However, UPF must communicate with the session management function (SMF), which will send the packet processing rules to UPF. Those rules will substantially occupy UPF storage. Moreover, customizing a UPF needs to reconstruct N3, N4, N6, and N9 interfaces, which takes much time for developers. To this end, we propose the user plane function development framework (UPFDF), which modularizes the functions in the UPF, supporting customization to connect different types of packet processing mechanisms. With UPFDF, we address the UPF capacity problem and improve the flexibility of the system.},

Recently, software-defined networking (SDN) based architectures (i.e., cockpit network communications environment testing (COMET)) have been proposed for Air-Ground communication. However, an evil can break the communication between a pilot and air traffic control, resulting in a hazardous (or life-threatening) situation up in the air or failure of ground equipment. This paper proposes an efficient evil detection and prevention mechanism (called DoEF) for the COMET architecture. The proposed DoEF utilizes a deep learning-based approach, i.e., long-short term memory (LSTM), to detect the evil flies and provide possible countermeasures. Our preliminary results show that the proposed scheme reduces the detection time and increases the detection accuracy of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks for the aviation network.},

abstract = {High-Intensity Interval Training is one of the most popular and dynamically developing fitness innovations in recent years. Professional runners have used interval training for a long time, alternating between high intensity sprints and low intensity jogging intervals to improve their overall performance. During such exercises, the accurate monitoring and prediction of heart rate dynamics is of particular importance to control the physiological state of a person and prevent possible pathological consequences. At the same time, heart rate estimation using very popular nowadays wearable devices (like smartwatches, fitness belts, etc.) during high-intensity exercises can be quite inaccurate. This inaccuracy mostly happens since the heart rate sensors (photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG)) are exposed to noises due to motion artifacts. PPG sensor suffers from periodic ambient light saturation due to intensive hand motions. ECG is noisy due to electrode contact area changes by body deformation. To solve the mentioned problem, in the current paper a deep learning framework for motion resistive heart rate estimation is developed. The system combines signal processing approaches for the raw sensor data processing and a deep learning architectures (convolutional and recurrent neural networks) for a real-time heart rate measurements and forecasting future heart rate dynamics.},

abstract = {Pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensors are considered to be promising devices for device-free localization due to its advantages of low cost, energy efficiency, and the immunity from multi-path fading. However, most of the existing PIR-based localization systems only utilize the binary information of PIR sensors and therefore require a large number of carefully deployed PIR sensors. A few works directly map the raw data of PIR sensors to one's location using machine learning approaches. However, these data-driven approaches require abundant training data and suffer from environmental change. In this paper, we propose PIRATES, a PIR-based device-free localization system based on the raw data of PIR sensors. The key of PIRATES is to extract a new type of location information called azimuth change. The extraction of the azimuth change relies on the physical properties of PIR sensors. Therefore, no abundant training data are needed and the system is robust to environmental change. Through experiments, we demonstrate that PIRATES can achieve higher localization accuracy than the state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, the information of the azimuth change can be easily incorporated with other information of PIR signals (e.g. amplitude) to improve the localization accuracy.},

We exploit the small wavelength of mm-wave to achieve strong signal isolation between transmit and receive antennas. We further build a custom IC that achieves high-bandwidth analog cancellation at mm-wave frequencies. Finally, we present digital self-interference cancellation algorithms that address the unique hardware impairments observed at mm-wave frequencies.

abstract = {The recent innovation of frequency-shifted (FS) backscatter allows for backscattering with commodity devices, which are inherently half-duplex. However, their reliance on oscillators for generating the frequency-shifting signal on the tag, forces them to incur the transient phase of the oscillator before steady-state operation. We show how the oscillator's transient phase can pose a fundamental limitation for battery-less tags, resulting in significantly low bandwidth efficiencies, thereby limiting their practical usage.To this end, we propose a novel approach to FS-backscatter called xSHIFT that shifts the core functionality of FS away from the tag and onto the commodity device, thereby eliminating the need for on-tag oscillators altogether. The key innovation in xSHIFT lies in addressing the formidable challenges that arise in making this vision a reality. Specifically, xSHIFT's design is built on the construct of beating twin carrier tones through a non-linear device to generate the desired FS signal - while the twin RF carriers are generated externally through a careful embedding into the resource units of commodity WiFi transmissions, the beating is achieved through a carefully-designed passive tag circuitry. We prototype xSHIFT's tag, which is the same form factor as RFID Gen 2 tags, and characterize its promising real-world performance. We believe xSHIFT demonstrates one of the first, truly passive tag designs that has the potential to bring commodity backscatter to consumer spaces.},

Designing EagleEye involves critical technical challenges for both accuracy and latency. Firstly, despite recent advances in Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based face identification, we observe that state-of-the-art models fail to accurately identify Low-Resolution (LR) faces. Accordingly, we design a novel Identity Clarification Network to recover missing details in the LR faces, which enhances true positives by 78% with only 14% false positives. Furthermore, designing EagleEye involves unique challenges compared to recent continuous mobile vision systems in that it requires running a series of complex DNNs multiple times on a high-resolution image. To tackle the challenge, we develop Content-Adaptive Parallel Execution to optimize complex multi-DNN face identification pipeline execution latency using heterogeneous processors on mobile and cloud. Our results show that EagleEye achieves 9.07X faster latency compared to naive execution, with only 108 KBytes of data offloaded.},

We found that straightforwardly activating all the arrays may even hamper network performance. To fully exploit the APA's potential, we propose X-Array, which jointly selects the arrays and beams, and applies a dynamic co-phasing mechanism to ensure different arrays' signals enhance each other. X-Array also incorporates a link recovery mechanism to identify alternative arrays/beams that can efficiently recover the link from outage. We have implemented X-Array on a commodity 802.11ad APA radio. Our experiments demonstrate that X-Array can approach omni-directional coverage and maintain high performance in spite of link dynamics.},

RetroI2V features a suite of novel VLBC designs including late-polarization, complementary optical signaling and polarization-based differential reception which are crucial to avoid flickering and achieve long VLBC range, as well as a decentralized MAC protocol that make practical multiple access in highly mobile and transient I2V settings. Experimental results from our prototyped system show that RetroI2V supports up to 101 m communication range and efficient multiple access at scale.},

The core challenge is two-fold: (1) accurately estimating the AoAs of multipath echoes without the knowledge of the source signal, and (2) tracing back these AoAs to reverse triangulate the user's location.We develop VoLoc, a system that proposes an iterative align-and-cancel algorithm for improved multipath AoA estimation, followed by an error-minimization technique to estimate the geometry of a nearby wall reflection. The AoAs and geometric parameters of the nearby wall are then fused to reveal the user's location. Under modest assumptions, we report localization accuracy of 0.44 m across different rooms, clutter, and user/microphone locations. VoLoc runs in near real-time but needs to hear around 15 voice commands before becoming operational.},

abstract = {IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) is an essential framework for providing 4G/5G multimedia services. It has been deployed worldwide to support two call services: VoLTE (Voice over LTE) and VoWi-Fi (Voice over Wi-Fi). VoWi-Fi enables telephony calls over the Wi-Fi network to complement VoLTE. In this work, we uncover that the VoWi-Fi signaling session can be hijacked to maliciously manipulate the IMS call operation. An adversary can easily make ghost calls to launch a stealthy call DoS (Denial of Service) attack against specific cellular users. Only phone numbers, but not any malware or network information, are required from the victims. This sophisticated attack harnesses a design defect of the IMS call state machine, but not simply flooding or a crash trigger. To stealthily detect attackable phones at run time, we exploit a vulnerability of the 4G network infrastructure, call information leakage, which we explore using machine learning. We validate these vulnerabilities in operational 4G networks of 4 top-tier carriers across Asia and North America countries with 7 phone brands. Our result shows that the call DoS attack can prevent the victims from receiving incoming calls up to 99.0% time without user awareness. We finally propose and evaluate recommended solutions.},

abstract = {Global Positioning System is a widely adopted localization technique. With the increasing demand for small satellites, the need for a low-power GPS for satellites is also increasing. To enable many state-of-the-art applications, the exact position of the satellites is necessary. However, building low-power GPS receivers which operate in low earth orbit pose significant challenges. This is mainly due to the high speed (~7.8 km/s) of small satellites. While duty-cycling the receiver is a possible solution, the high relative Doppler shift between the GPS satellites and the small satellite contributes to the increase in Time To First Fix (TTFF), thus increasing the energy consumption. Further, if the GPS receiver is tumbling along with the small satellite on which it is mounted, longer TTFF may lead to no GPS fix due to disorientation of the receiver antenna. In this paper, we elucidate the design of a low-cost, low-power GPS receiver for small satellite applications. We also propose an energy optimization algorithm called F3to improve the TTFF which is the main contributor to the energy consumption during cold start. With simulations and in-orbit evaluation from a launched nanosatellite with our μGPS and high-end GPS simulators, we show that up to 96.16% of energy savings (consuming only ~ 1/25th energy compared to the state of the art) can be achieved using our algorithm without compromising much (~10 m) on the navigation accuracy. The TTFF achieved is at most 33 s.},

abstract = {In the last decade, the bandwidth expansion and MIMO spatial multiplexing have promised to increase data throughput by orders of magnitude. However, we are yet to enjoy such improvement in real-world environments, as they lack rich scattering and preclude effective MIMO spatial multiplexing. In this paper, we present ScatterMIMO, which uses smart surface to increase the scattering in the environment, to provide MIMO spatial multiplexing gain. Specifically, smart surface pairs up with a wireless transmitter device say an active AP and re-radiates the same amount of power as any active access point (AP), thereby creating virtual passive APs. ScatterMIMO avoids the synchronization, interference, and power requirements of conventional distributed MIMO systems by leveraging virtual passive APs, allowing its smart surface to provide spatial multiplexing gain, which can be deployed at a very low cost. We show that with optimal placement, these virtual APs can provide signals to their clients with power comparable to real active APs, and can increase the coverage of an AP. Furthermore, we design algorithms to optimize ScatterMIMO's smart surface for each client with minimal measurement overhead and to overcome random per-packet phase offsets during the measurement. Our evaluations show that with commercial off-the-shelf MIMO WiFi (11ac) AP and unmodified clients, ScatterMIMO provides a median throughput improvement of 2 X over the active AP alone.},

We conduct a detailed investigation of each of the following aspects for point cloud streaming (a popular volumetric data format): encoding, decoding, segmentation, viewport movement patterns, and viewport prediction. Motivated by the observations from the above study, we propose ViVo, which is to the best of our knowledge the first practical mobile volumetric video streaming system with three visibility-aware optimizations. ViVo judiciously determines the video content to fetch based on how, what and where a viewer perceives for reducing bandwidth consumption of volumetric video streaming. Our evaluations over real wireless networks (including commercial 5G), mobile devices and users indicate that ViVo can save on average 40% of data usage (up to 80%) with virtually no drop in visual quality.},

abstract = {Drug effectiveness management is a complicated and challenging task in chronic diseases, like Parkinson's Disease (PD). Drug effectiveness control is not only linked to personal out-of-pocket cost but also affecting the quality of life among patients with chronic symptoms. In the current practice, although that health and medical professionals still play a key role in the personalized treatment plan, the critical decision on drug selection falls upon the individual report when patients call in or visit the clinics. Unfortunately, most of the patients with chronic diseases either fail to report their day-to-day symptoms or have a limited access to medical resources due to economic constraints. In this paper, we present PDLens, a first smartphone-based system to detect drug effectiveness among Parkinson's in daily life. Specifically, PDLens can extract digital behavioral markers related to PD drug responses from everyday activities, including phone calls, standing, and walking. PDLens models the PD symptom severity on drug treatment and detects the change of severity scores before and after drug intake. A ranking-based multi-view deep neural network is developed to decide the drug effectiveness upon the symptom severity changes. To validate the performance of PDLens, we conduct a pilot study with 81 PD patients and monitor their smartphone activities and severity changes over 33693 drug intake events across six (6) months. Compared with the standard clinical drug effectiveness test developed by Motor Disorder Society, results reveal that PDLens is a promising tool to facilitate drug effectiveness detection among PD patients in their daily lives.},

abstract = {The recent years have witnessed the rapid growth of IoT (Internet of Things) applications. A typical IoT application usually consists of three essential parts: the device side, the cloud side, and the client side. The development of a complete IoT application is very difficult for non-expert developers because it involves drastically different technologies and complex interactions between different sides. Unlike traditional IoT development platforms which use separate approaches for these three sides, we present TinyLink 2.0, an integrated IoT development approach with a single coherent language. It achieves high expressiveness for diverse IoT applications by an enhanced IFTTT rule design and a virtual sensor mechanism which helps developers express application logic with machine learning. Moreover, TinyLink 2.0 optimizes the IoT application performance by using both static and dynamic optimizers, especially for resource-constrained IoT devices. We implement TinyLink 2.0 and evaluate it with eight case studies, a user study, and a detailed evaluation of the proposed programming language as well as the performance optimizers. Results show that TinyLink 2.0 can speed up IoT development significantly compared with existing approaches from both industry and academia, while still achieving high expressiveness.},

abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technologies represent a cornerstone for emerging wireless network infrastructure, and for RF sensing systems in security, health, and automotive domains. Through a MIMO array of phased arrays with hundreds of antenna elements, mmWave can boost wireless bit-rates to 100+ Gbps, and potentially achieve near-vision sensing resolution. However, the lack of an experimental platform has been impeding research in this field. This paper fills the gap with M3 (M-Cube), the first mmWave massive MIMO software radio. M3 features a fully reconfigurable array of phased arrays, with up to 8 RF chains and 288 antenna elements. Despite the orders of magnitude larger antenna arrays, its cost is orders of magnitude lower, even when compared with state-of-the-art single RF chain mmWave software radios. The key design principle behind M3 is to hijack a low-cost commodity 802.11ad radio, separate the control path and data path inside, regenerate the phased array control signals, and recreate the data signals using a programmable baseband. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the M3 design, and its usefulness for research in mmWave massive MIMO communication and sensing.},

abstract = {Location services, fundamentally, rely on two components: a mapping system and a positioning system. The mapping system provides the physical map of the space, and the positioning system identifies the position within the map. Outdoor location services have thrived over the last couple of decades because of well-established platforms for both these components (e.g. Google Maps for mapping, and GPS for positioning). In contrast, indoor location services haven't caught up because of the lack of reliable mapping and positioning frameworks. Wi-Fi positioning lacks maps and is also prone to environmental errors. In this paper, we present DLoc, a Deep Learning based wireless localization algorithm that can overcome traditional limitations of RF-based localization approaches (like multipath, occlusions, etc.). We augment DLoc with an automated mapping platform, MapFind. MapFind constructs location-tagged maps of the environment and generates training data for DLoc. Together, they allow off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices like smartphones to access a map of the environment and to estimate their position with respect to that map. During our evaluation, MapFind has collected location estimates of over 105 thousand points under 8 different scenarios with varying furniture positions and people motion across two different spaces covering 2000 sq. Ft. DLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods in Wi-Fi-based localization by 80% (median &amp; 90th percentile) across the two different spaces.},

abstract = {THz communication has the potential to realize an order of magnitude increase in data rates due to the availability of wide THz-scale spectral bands. Unfortunately, establishing and managing highly directional beams in THz networks is challenging as links lack the "pseudo-omni" reception capability of lower bands and the product of AP-client beam resolution is high due to narrow beams of only a few degrees. In this paper, we present One-shot Path discovEry with a THz RAinbow (OPERA), a novel system that identifies dominant paths between the AP and all clients in order to efficiently steer directional beams. The key idea is to embed path direction into the inherent characteristics of signals traveling along each path. To do so, we exploit a single leaky wave antenna and create a THz Rainbow. A THz Rainbow transmission consists of distinct signals with unique spectral characteristics across the angular domain. Leveraging the spatial-spectral signatures in the THz Rainbow, all receivers can correlate the measured signal with the known transmission signatures to discover the sender's path directions in one-shot. Our experiments demonstrate that OPERA achieves average direction estimates within 2° of ground truth for LOS and reflected paths.},

abstract = {Electric toothbrushes are widely used for home oral care, but many users do not achieve desired hygiene results due to insufficient brushing coverage or incorrect brushing techniques. Existing electric toothbrushing monitoring systems fail to detect these issues because they cannot achieve fine-grained position tracking. In this paper, we present a novel electric toothbrushing monitoring system called MET that tracks brushing coverage for all the 15 surfaces of teeth and detects different types of incorrect brushing techniques. This design is inspired by our observation that the motor inside an electric toothbrush generates a unique magnetic field, which can serve as a reliable signal for position and orientation tracking. MET is the first system that tracks both the position and orientation of an unmodified electric motor using magnetic inductive sensing. Experiments with fourteen users show that the average toothbrushing surface recognition accuracy of MET is 85.3%. Moreover, MET is robust to user location changes and posture variations and does not require any training from the users. Experimental results also demonstrate our significant advantages over existing commercial systems.},

abstract = {Almost every Android user has unsatisfying experiences regarding responsiveness, in particular Application Not Responding (ANR) and System Not Responding (SNR) that directly disrupt user experience. Unfortunately, the community have limited understanding of the prevalence, characteristics, and root causes of unresponsiveness. In this paper, we make an in-depth study of ANR and SNR at scale based on fine-grained system-level traces crowdsourced from 30,000 Android systems. We find that ANR and SNR occur prevalently on all the studied 15 hardware models, and better hardware does not seem to relieve the problem. Moreover, as Android evolves from version 7.0 to 9.0, there are fewer ANR events but more SNR events. Most importantly, we uncover multifold root causes of ANR and SNR and pinpoint the largest inefficiency which roots in Android's flawed implementation of Write Amplification Mitigation (WAM). We design a practical approach to eliminating this largest root cause; after large-scale deployment, it reduces almost all (&gt;99%) ANR and SNR caused by WAM while only decreasing 3% of the data write speed. In addition, we document important lessons we have learned from this study, and have also released our measurement code/data to the research community.},

abstract = {Wireless communication over long distances has become the bottleneck for battery-powered, large-scale deployments. Currently used low-power protocols such as Zigbee and Bluetooth Low Energy have limited communication range, whereas long-range communication strategies used in cellular and satellite networks are heavy on energy consumption. Methods that use narrow-band communication such as LoRa, SigFox, and NB-IoT have low spectral efficiency, leading to scalability issues. The goal of this work is to develop a communication framework that can satisfy the following requirements: (1) Increased battery life, (2) Longer communication range, (3) Scalability in a wireless network. In this work, we propose, design, and prototype WiChronos, a communication paradigm that encodes information in the time interval between two narrowband symbols in order to drastically reduce the energy consumption in a wide area network with a large number of senders. We leverage the low data-rate and relaxed latency requirements of such applications to achieve the desired features identified above. Based on our prototype using off-the-shelf components, WiChronos achieves an impressive 60% improvement in battery life compared to state-of-the-art LPWAN technologies at distances of over 800 meters. We also show that more than 1000 WiChronos senders can co-exist with less than 5% probability of collisions under low traffic conditions.},

In-N-Out can continuously charge a medical implant residing in deep tissues at near-optimal beamforming power, even when the implant moves around inside the human body. To accomplish this, we exploit the unique energy ball pattern of distributed antenna array and devise a backscatter-assisted beamforming algorithm that can concentrate RF energy on a tiny spot surrounding the medical implant. Meanwhile, the power levels on other body parts stay in low level, reducing the risk of overheating. We proto-type In-N-Out on 21 software-defined radios and a printed circuit board (PCB). Extensive experiments demonstrate that In-N-Out achieves 0.37 mW average charging power inside a 10 cm-thick pork belly, which is sufficient to wirelessly power a range of commercial medical devices. Our head-to-head comparison with the state-of-the-art approach shows that In-N-Out achieves 5.4X-18.1X power gain when the implant is stationary, and 5.3X-7.4X power gain when the implant is in motion.},

abstract = {This paper presents WiPose, the first 3D human pose construction framework using commercial WiFi devices. From the pervasive WiFi signals, WiPose can reconstruct 3D skeletons composed of the joints on both limbs and torso of the human body. By overcoming the technical challenges faced by traditional camera-based human perception solutions, such as lighting and occlusion, the proposed WiFi human sensing technique demonstrates the potential to enable a new generation of applications such as health care, assisted living, gaming, and virtual reality. WiPose is based on a novel deep learning model that addresses a series of technical challenges. First, WiPose can encode the prior knowledge of human skeleton into the posture construction process to ensure the estimated joints satisfy the skeletal structure of the human body. Second, to achieve cross environment generalization, WiPose takes as input a 3D velocity profile which can capture the movements of the whole 3D space, and thus separate posture-specific features from the static objects in the ambient environment. Finally, WiPose employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) and a smooth loss to enforce smooth movements of the generated skeletons. Our evaluation results on a real-world WiFi sensing testbed with distributed antennas show that WiPose can localize each joint on the human skeleton with an average error of 2.83cm, achieving a 35% improvement in accuracy over the state-of-the-art posture construction model designed for dedicated radar sensors.},

abstract = {With increasing private and sensitive data stored in mobile devices, secure and effective mobile-based user authentication schemes are desired. As the most natural way to contact with mobile devices, finger touches have shown potentials for user authentication. Most existing approaches utilize finger touches as behavioral biometrics for identifying individuals, which are vulnerable to spoofer attacks. To resist attacks for on-touch user authentication on mobile devices, this paper exploits physical characters of touching fingers by investigating active vibration signal transmission through fingers, and we find that physical characters of touching fingers present unique patterns on active vibration signals for different individuals. Based on the observation, we propose a behavior-irrelevant on-touch user authentication system, TouchPass, which leverages active vibration signals on smartphones to extract only physical characters of touching fingers for user identification. TouchPass first extracts features that mix physical characters of touching fingers and behavior biometrics of touching behaviors from vibration signals generated and received by smartphones. Then, we design a Siamese network-based architecture with a specific training sample selection strategy to reconstruct the extracted signal features to behavior-irrelevant features and further build a behavior-irrelevant on-touch user authentication scheme leveraging knowledge distillation. Our extensive experiments validate that TouchPass can accurately authenticate users and defend various attacks.},

abstract = {Energy consumption of Internet-of-Things end devices is a major constraint that limits their long-term and large-scale deployment. Conventionally, the radios and processors used in these end devices are major power consumption that drains at the level of milliwatts (mWs). However, in recent decades, backscatter communication has dramatically reduced the power consumed by the radios in end devices to microwatts (μWs), and thus the processor remains the major bottleneck for energy optimization.In this paper, we propose a processor-free architecture as a novel design that allows the radio to interface directly with peripheral sensor chips for control and data collection, thereby separating the processors from the end device design to significantly reduce the energy consumed by end devices. The main problem is that the peripheral chips are designed to be accessed by the processor via a standard digital bus and they cannot communicate directly with the radio. In order to support such processor-free design, we propose radio-to-bus (R2B) as a novel communication paradigm that allows direct data exchange between a backscatter radio and the serial peripheral interface (SPI) bus. We implement the processor-free architecture in proof-of-concept prototypes and demonstrate that the power consumption decreases by 4.5 times compared with the conventional end device design.},

abstract = {Small unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs) swarms are becoming ubiquitous in a number of applications (e.g., surveying, monitoring, and situational awareness). Indoor environments may contain metal equipment that temporarily disrupts radio reception. During these momentary interruptions, a small UAV needs to be able to broadcast a 'heartbeat' to indicate that it is not damaged or lost. Considering alternative messaging modalities, we observe that light-based methods require line-of sight, which is not guaranteed when UAVs are moving through a cluttered environment, while a naive sound-based method is easily drowned out by the UAV's own loud motor and propeller noise.We present Bleep, a side-channel messaging system that modulates UAV motors sounds to enable multiple UAVs to communicate when radio is unavailable. Bleep accomplishes this by 1) embedding linear chirps within the PWM frequency while maintaining the controllability of the UAV and 2) decoding the received sounds utilizing chirp multiplication to enhance signal detection in loud motor noise. Our chirp-based encoding allows multiple simultaneous transmissions to be detected and decoded in the presence of loud sounds from multiple UAV motors. Through real-world experiments, we show that Bleep is able to achieve over 95% signal detection and decoding accuracy with simultaneous transmissions.},

abstract = {Temperature sensor is one of the most widespread technologies in the IoT era. Wireless temperature monitoring systems are convenient to deploy and can drive mass applications in the fields of smart home, transportation and logistics. Currently, wireless temperature monitoring products are based on microelectronic and semiconductor components, which are not cost-effective (e.g., a few dollars) and more importantly, generate electronic wastes. In this work, we present ThermoWave, a new paradigm of wireless temperature monitoring that is ecological, battery-less, and ultra-low cost. Specifically, ThermoWave is on the basis of the thermal scattering effect on millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals. Specifically, cholesteryl materials align their molecular patterns at different environmental temperatures, and this temperature-induced pattern change will be modulated and sensed by the scattered mmWave signals. There are three functional modules in the ThermoWave system. The ThermoTag is a cholesteryl material inked film or paper tag that can be conveniently attached to the object of interest to monitor temperature changes. Each ThermoTag costs less than 0.01 dollars. The temperature modulated mmWave scattering will be received by a mmWave-radar based ThermoScanner and demodulated by a software-based temperature decoder ThermoSense, which includes a model-based method (i.e., ThermoDot) for point temperature estimation and a data-driven method (i.e., ThermoNet) for thermal imaging. We prototype and evaluate the ThermoWave system performance in both controlled and real-world setups. Experimental results show that the ThermoWave achieves the precision of ±1.0°F in the range of 30°F to 120°F in a controlled setup. We also investigate the performance in real-world applications, and the ThermoWave can reach the ±3.0°F precision in the temperature estimation. We also test and discuss sustainability, durability, robustness, and cost-effectiveness of the ThermoWave in both design and experiments.},

Unfortunately, mobile devices cannot benefit from this because it is too expensive in computation and power-hungry.To overcome the limitation, we present NEMO, a system that enables real-time video super-resolution on mobile devices. NEMO applies neural super-resolution to a few select frames and transfers the outputs to benefit the remaining frames. The frames to which super-resolution is applied are carefully chosen to maximize the overall quality gains. NEMO leverages fine-grained dependencies using information from the video codec and strives to provide guarantees in the quality degradation compared to per-frame super-resolution. Our evaluation using a full system implementation on Android shows NEMO improves the overall processing throughput by x11.5, reduces energy consumption by 88.6%, and maintains device temperatures at acceptable levels compared to per-frame super-resolution, while ensuring high video quality. Overall, this leads to a 31.2% improvement in quality of experience for mobile users.},

abstract = {Machine learning models, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have demonstrated great potential in optimizing video streaming applications. However, the state-of-the-art solutions are limited to an "offline learning" paradigm, i.e., the RL models are trained in simulators and then are operated in real networks. As a result, they inevitably suffer from the simulation-to-reality gap, showing far less satisfactory performance under real conditions compared with simulated environment. In this work, we close the gap by proposing OnRL, an online RL framework for real-time mobile video telephony. OnRL puts many individual RL agents directly into the video telephony system, which make video bitrate decisions in real-time and evolve their models over time. OnRL then aggregates these agents to form a high-level RL model that can help each individual to react to unseen network conditions. Moreover, OnRL incorporates novel mechanisms to handle the adverse impacts of inherent video traffic dynamics, and to eliminate risks of quality degradation caused by the RL model's exploration attempts. We implement OnRL on a mainstream operational video telephony system, Alibaba Taobao-live. In a month-long evaluation with 543 hours of video sessions from 151 real-world mobile users, OnRL outperforms the prior algorithms significantly, reducing video stalling rate by 14.22% while maintaining similar video quality.},

abstract = {Visible light communication (VLC) is gaining a significant amount of interest as a new paradigm to meet rapidly increasing demands on wireless capacity required by a digitalized world. VLC is considered as a secure wireless communication scheme because VLC signals can be easily constrained within physical boundaries. In this paper, for the first time, we show that VLC is not as secure as people thought: VLC can be sniffed through walls! The key principle behind this is that in VLC transmissions, a VLC transmitter not only emits visible light signals but also leaks out 'side channel RF signals'. The leaked RF signals can be sniffed by a receiver to decode the VLC transmissions even the receiver is blocked (e.g., by walls) from the VLC transmitter. In this work, we establish a theoretical model to quantify the amplitude of the leaked RF signal and verify the model with comprehensive experiments. We design and implement a VLC sniffing system including receiver coil design, signal processing and frame decoding, spanning across hardware and software. Field studies show that with a cheap receiver design, our system can simultaneously sniff transmissions from multiple VLC transmitters 6.4 meters away with a 14 cm concrete wall in between, where the distance exceeds the communication range of most state-of-the-art VLC systems. By simply twining a wired earphone on the arm, we can sniff the VLC transmission 1.9 meters away.},

abstract = {Federated learning was proposed with an intriguing vision of achieving collaborative machine learning among numerous clients without uploading their private data to a cloud server. However, the conventional framework requires each client to leverage the full model for learning, which can be prohibitively inefficient for large-scale learning tasks and resource-constrained mobile devices. Thus, we proposed a submodel framework, where clients download only the needed parts of the full model, namely, submodels, and then upload the submodel updates. Nevertheless, the "position" of a client's truly required submodel corresponds to its private data, while the disclosure of the true position to the cloud server during interactions inevitably breaks the tenet of federated learning. To integrate efficiency and privacy, we designed a secure federated submodel learning scheme coupled with a private set union protocol as a cornerstone. The secure scheme features the properties of randomized response, secure aggregation, and Bloom filter, and endows each client with customized plausible deniability (in terms of local differential privacy) against the position of its desired submodel, thereby protecting private data. We further instantiated the scheme with Alibaba's e-commerce recommendation, implemented a prototype system, and extensively evaluated over 30-day Taobao user data. Empirical results demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of the proposed scheme as well as its remarkable advantages over the conventional federated learning framework, from model accuracy and convergency, practical communication, computation, and storage overhead.},

abstract = {With the explosive increase in wireless devices, physical-layer signal analysis has become critically beneficial across distinctive domains including interference minimization in network planning, security and privacy (e.g., drone and spycam detection), and mobile health with remote sensing. While SDR is known to be highly effective in realizing such services, they are rarely deployed or used by the end-users due to the costly hardware ~1K USD (e.g., USRP). Low-cost SDRs (e.g., RTL-SDR) are available, but their bandwidth is limited to 2-3 MHz and operation range falls well below 2.4 GHz - the unlicensed band holding majority of the wireless devices. This paper presents SDR-Lite, the first zero-cost, software-only software defined radio (SDR) receiver that empowers commodity WiFi to retrieve the In-phase and Quadrature of an ambient signal. With the full compatibility to pervasively-deployed WiFi infrastructure (without any change to the hardware and firmware), SDR-Lite aims to spread the blessing of SDR receiver functionalities to billions of WiFi users and households to enhance our everyday lives. The key idea of SDR-Lite is to trick WiFi to begin packet reception (i.e., the decoding process) when the packet is absent, so that it accepts ambient signals in the air and outputs corresponding bits. The bits are then reconstructed to the original physical-layer waveform, on which diverse SDR applications are performed. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that the reconstructed signal closely reassembles the original ambient signal (&gt;85% correlation). We extensively demonstrate SDR-Lite effectiveness across seven distinctive SDR receiver applications under three representative categories: (i) RF fingerprinting, (ii) spectrum monitoring, and (iii) (ZigBee) decoding. For instance, in security applications of drone and rogue WiFi AP detection, SDR-Lite achieves 99% and 97% accuracy, which is comparable to USRP.},

abstract = {Social scientists, psychologists, and epidemiologists use empirical human interaction data to research human behaviour, social bonding, and disease spread. Historically, systems measuring interactions have been forced to choose between deployability and measurement fidelity---they operate only in instrumented spaces, under line-of-sight conditions, or provide coarse-grained proximity data. We introduce SociTrack, a platform for autonomous social interaction tracking via wireless distance measurements. Deployments require no supporting infrastructure and provide sub-second, decimeter-accurate ranging information over multiple days. The key insight that enables both deployability and fidelity in one system is to decouple node mobility and network management from range measurement, which results in a novel dual-radio architecture. SociTrack leverages an energy-efficient and scalable ranging protocol that is accurate to 14.8 cm (99th percentile) in complex indoor environments and allows our prototype to operate for 12 days on a 2000 mAh battery. Finally, to validate its deployability and efficacy, SociTrack is used by early childhood development researchers to capture caregiver-infant interactions.},

In this paper, we aim to explore the molecular communication channel through theoretical and empirical modeling in order to achieve a better understanding of its characteristics, which tend to be more complex in practice than traditional wireless and wired channels. Our study reveals two key new characteristics that have been overlooked by past work. Specifically, the molecular communication channel exhibits non-causal inter-symbol-interference and a long delay spread, that extends beyond the channel coherence time, which limit decoding performance. To address this, we design, μ-Link a molecular communication protocol and decoder that accounts for these new insights. We build a testbed to experimentally validate our findings and show that μ-Link can improve the achievable data rates with significantly lower bit error rates.},

Future AR apps impose an explored challenging workload: i) concurrent execution of multiple Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for physical world and user behavior analysis, and ii) seamless rendering in presence of the DNN execution for immersive user experience. Existing mobile deep learning frameworks, however, fail to support such workload: multi-DNN GPU contention slows down inference latency (e.g., from 59.93 to 1181 ms), and rendering-DNN GPU contention degrades frame rate (e.g., from 30 to ≈12 fps). Multi-tasking for desktop GPUs (e.g., parallelization, preemption) cannot be applied to mobile GPUs as well due to limited architectural support and memory bandwidth. To tackle the challenge, we design a Pseudo-Preemption mechanism which i) breaks down the bulky DNN into smaller units, and ii) prioritizes and flexibly schedules concurrent GPU tasks. We prototyped Heimdall over various mobile GPUs (i.e., recent Adreno series) and multiple AR app scenarios that involve combinations of 8 state-of-the-art DNNs. Our extensive evaluation shows that Heimdall enhances the frame rate from ≈12 to ≈30 fps while reducing the worst-case DNN inference latency by up to ≈15 times compared to the baseline multi-threading approach.},

abstract = {We propose Nephelai, a Compressive Sensing-based Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN), to reduce the uplink bit rate of the physical layer (PHY) between the gateways and the cloud server for multi-channel LPWANs. Recent research shows that single-channel LPWANs suffer from scalability issues. While multiple channels improve these issues, data transmission is expensive. Furthermore, recent research has shown that jointly decoding raw physical layers that are offloaded by LPWAN gateways in the cloud can improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of week radio signals. However, when it comes to multiple channels, this approach requires high bandwidth of network infrastructure to transport a large amount of PHY samples from gateways to the cloud server, which results in network congestion and high cost due to Internet data usage. In order to reduce the operation's bandwidth, we propose a novel LPWAN packet acquisition mechanism based on Compressive Sensing with a custom design dictionary that exploits the structure of LPWAN packets, reduces the bit rate of samples on each gateway, and demodulates PHY in the cloud with (joint) sparse approximation. Moreover, we propose an adaptive compression method that takes the Spreading Factor (SF) and SNR into account. Our empirical evaluation shows that up to 93.7% PHY samples can be reduced by Nephelai when SF = 9 and SNR is high without degradation in the packet reception rate (PRR). With four gateways, 1.7x PRR can be achieved with 87.5% PHY samples compressed, which can extend the battery lifetime of embedded IoT devices to 1.7.},

abstract = {Despite the soaring use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in mobile applications, uniformly sustaining high-performance inference on mobile has been elusive due to the excessive computational demands of modern CNNs and the increasing diversity of deployed devices. A popular alternative comprises offloading CNN processing to powerful cloud-based servers. Nevertheless, by relying on the cloud to produce outputs, emerging mission-critical and high-mobility applications, such as drone obstacle avoidance or interactive applications, can suffer from the dynamic connectivity conditions and the uncertain availability of the cloud. In this paper, we propose SPINN, a distributed inference system that employs synergistic device-cloud computation together with a progressive inference method to deliver fast and robust CNN inference across diverse settings. The proposed system introduces a novel scheduler that co-optimises the early-exit policy and the CNN splitting at run time, in order to adapt to dynamic conditions and meet user-defined service-level requirements. Quantitative evaluation illustrates that SPINN outperforms its state-of-the-art collaborative inference counterparts by up to 2\texttimes{} in achieved throughput under varying network conditions, reduces the server cost by up to 6.8\texttimes{} and improves accuracy by 20.7% under latency constraints, while providing robust operation under uncertain connectivity conditions and significant energy savings compared to cloud-centric execution.},

abstract = {The growing diversification of mobile services imposes requirements on network performance that are ever more stringent and heterogeneous. Network slicing aligns mobile network operation to this context, by enabling operators to isolate and customize network resources on a per-service basis. A key input for provisioning resources to slices is real-time information about the traffic demands generated by individual services. Acquiring such knowledge is however challenging, as legacy approaches based on in-depth inspection of traffic streams have high computational costs, which inflate with the widening adoption of encryption over data and control traffic. In this paper, we present a new approach to service-level demand estimation for slicing, which hinges on decomposition, i.e., the inference of per-service demands from traffic aggregates. By operating on total traffic volumes only, our approach overcomes the complexity and limitations of legacy traffic classification techniques, and provides a suitable input to recent 'Network Slice as a Service' (NSaaS) models. We implement decomposition through Microscope, a novel framework that uses deep learning to infer individual service demands from complex spatiotemporal features hidden in traffic aggregates. Microscope (i) transforms traffic data collected in irregular radio access deployments in a format suitable for convolutional learning, and (ii) can accommodate a variety of neural network architectures, including original 3D Deformable Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-DefCNNs) that we explicitly design for decomposition. Experiments with measurement data collected in an operational network demonstrate that Microscope accurately estimates per-service traffic demands with relative errors below 1.2%. Further, tests in practical NSaaS management use cases show that resource allocations informed by decomposition yield affordable costs for the mobile network operator.},

abstract = {Inexpensive and highly capable unmanned aerial vehicles (aka drones) have enabled people to contribute high-quality videos at a global scale. However, a key challenge exists for accepting videos from untrusted sources: establishing when a particular video was taken. Once a video has been received or posted publicly, it is evident that the video was created before that time, but there are no current methods for establishing how long it was made before that time.We propose C-141, a system that assures the earliest timestamp, tb, of drone-made videos. C-14 provides a challenge to an untrusted drone requiring it to execute a sequence of motions, called a motion program, revealed only after tb. It then uses camera pose estimation techniques to verify the resulting video matches the challenge motion program, thus assuring the video was taken after tb. We demonstrate the system on manually crafted programs representing a large space of possible motion programs. We also propose and evaluate an example algorithm which generates motion programs based on a seed value released after tb. C-14 incorporates a number of compression and sampling techniques to reduce the computation required to verify videos. We can verify a 59-second video from an eight-motion, manual motion program, in 91 seconds of computation with a false positive rate of one in 1013 and no false negatives. We can also verify a 190-second video from an algorithmically derived, 4-motion program, in 158 seconds of computation with a false positive rate of one in one hundred thousand and no false negatives.},

These vibrations are strong enough to propagate to the edge of the face and produce vibratory signals at an earphone. By re-tasking the earphone speaker as an input transducer - a software modification in the sound card - we are able to sense teeth-related gestures across various models of ear/headphones. In fact, by analyzing the signals at the two earphones, we show the feasibility of also localizing teeth gestures, resulting in a human-to-machine interface. Challenges range from coping with weak signals, distortions due to different teeth compositions, lack of timing resolution, spectral dispersion, etc. We address these problems with a sequence of sensing techniques, resulting in the ability to detect 6 distinct gestures in real-time. Results from 18 volunteers exhibit robustness, even though our system - EarSense - does not depend on per-user training. Importantly, EarSense also remains robust in the presence of concurrent user activities, like walking, nodding, cooking and cycling. Our ongoing work is focused on detecting teeth gestures even while music is being played in the earphone; once that problem is solved, we believe EarSense could be even more compelling.},

abstract = {Instant delivery is an important urban service in recent years because of the increasing demand. An important issue for delivery platforms is to keep updating the status of couriers especially the real-time locations, which is challenging when they are in an indoor environment. We argue the previous indoor localization techniques cannot be applied in the instant delivery scenario because they require extra deployed infrastructures and extensive labor work. In this work, we perform the couriers' indoor localization transparently in a predictive manner without extra actions of couriers by existing data from the platform including order progress reports and couriers' trajectories. Specifically, we present TransLoc to predict couriers' indoor locations by addressing two challenges including uncertain reporting behaviors and uncertain indoor mobility behaviors. Our key idea lies in two insights (i) couriers' behaviors are consistent in indoor/outdoor environments; (ii) localization, as a spatial inference problem, could be converted to a temporal inference problem. We evaluate TransLoc on 565 couriers from an instant delivery company, which improves baselines by at most 72%, and achieves a competitive result compared to a label-extensive approach. As a case study, we apply TransLoc to optimize the order dispatching strategy, which reduces the delivery time by 24%.},

abstract = {Backscatter enables transmissions at orders of magnitude lower energy consumption when compared to conventional radio transmitters. Backscatter tags achieve this by the reflection or absorption of carrier signal generated from emitter devices. However, backscatter systems are limited by these emitter devices, as they are significantly energy-expensive when compared to the tags. While backscatter tags can operate without requiring batteries, relying on the minuscule amounts of energy harvested from the ambient environment. However, the emitter devices, are commonly tethered to an external power supply or operate on large batteries.We present Tunnel Emitter: a tunnel diode oscillator based system that enables the generation of carrier signals at a peak biasing power of tens of μW. Thus, for the first time, it allows battery-free emitter devices. The key enabler to the design is a phenomenon exhibited by tunnel diode oscillators that we call back injection, and we are the first to demonstrate. Back injection enables the emitter devices to amplify (up to 20 dB) and relay the backscattered signal. Our results show that Tunnel Emitter when operating together with a tag from long-range backscatter system, facilitates multi-floor communication. Tunnel Emitter, due to the back injection phenomenon, achieves this with a carrier signal that is orders of magnitude weaker than used in state-of-the-art systems. We believe Tunnel Emitter overcomes the key constraint restricting backscatter systems and thus can make backscatter systems ubiquitous.},

abstract = {Current LoRa networks including those following the LoRaWAN specification use the primitive ALOHA mechanism for media access control due to LoRa's lack of carrier sense capability. From our extensive measurements, the Channel Activity Detection (CAD) feature that is recently introduced to LoRa for energy-efficiently detecting preamble chirps, can also detect payload chirps reliably. This sheds light on an efficient carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) protocol that we call LMAC for LoRa networks. This paper presents the designs of three advancing versions of LMAC that respectively implements CSMA, balances the communication loads among the channels defined by frequencies and spreading factors based on the end nodes' local information and then additionally the gateway's global information. Experiments on a 50-node lab testbed and a 16-node university deployment show that, compared with ALOHA, LMAC brings up to 2.2\texttimes{} goodput improvement and 2.4\texttimes{} reduction of radio energy per successfully delivered frame. Thus, should the LoRaWAN's ALOHA be replaced with LMAC, network performance boosts can be realized.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose iCellSpeed, an on-device solution to increase data access speed by substantiating unrealized performance potentials. We find that performance potentials are missed in today's mobile networks, as the data speed a user device gets is much lower than what the device could get. The issue is rooted in the current cell selection practice, which misses good candidate cells that offer faster access speed, thus under-utilizing the available capabilities in mobile networks. We design iCellSpeed to facilitate network-controlled cell selection with proactive device-side assistance towards more desirable cells. Our evaluation over AT&amp;T and Verizon confirms its effectiveness. iCellSpeed increases data access speed by more than 10 Mbps at 79% of test locations (&gt; 25Mbps at 29% of locations, up to 80.6 Mbps). It doubles access speed at 62.5% of locations with the gain up to 28.4x. Datasets are available at [9].},

abstract = {Vibration measurement is a crucial task in industrial systems, where vibration characteristics reflect the health and indicate anomalies of the objects. Previous approaches either work in an intrusive manner or fail to capture the micrometer-level vibrations. In this work, we propose mmVib, a practical approach to measure micrometer-level vibrations with mmWave radar. By introducing a Multi-Signal Consolidation (MSC) model to describe the properties of the reflected signals, we exploit the inherent consistency among those signals to accurately recover the vibration characteristics. We implement a prototype of mmVib, and the experiments show that this design achieves 8.2% relative amplitude error and 0.5% relative frequency error in median. Typically, the median amplitude error is 3.4um for the 100um-amplitude vibration. Compared to two existing approaches, mmVib reduces the 80th-percentile amplitude error by 62.9% and 68.9% respectively.},

abstract = {Cellular service carriers often employ reactive strategies to assist customers who experience non-outage related individual service degradation issues (e.g., service performance degradations that do not impact customers at scale and are likely caused by network provisioning issues for individual devices). Customers need to contact customer care to request assistance before these issues are resolved. This paper presents our experience with PACE (<u>P</u>ro<u>A</u>ctive customer <u>C</u>ar<u>E</u>), a novel, proactive system that monitors, troubleshoots and resolves individual service issues, without having to rely on customers to first contact customer care for assistance. PACE seeks to improve customer experience and care operation efficiency by automatically detecting individual (non-outage related) service issues, prioritizing repair actions by predicting customers who are likely to contact care to report their issues, and proactively triggering actions to resolve these issues. We develop three machine learning-based prediction models, and implement a fully automated system that integrates these prediction models and takes resolution actions for individual customers. We conduct a large-scale trace-driven evaluation using real-world data collected from a major cellular carrier in the US, and demonstrate that PACE is able to predict customers who are likely to contact care due to non-outage related individual service issues with high accuracy. We further deploy PACE into this cellular carrier network. Our field trial results show that PACE is effective in proactively resolving non-outage related individual customer service issues, improving customer experience, and reducing the need for customers to report their service issues.},

abstract = {Wireless sensors have enabled a number of key applications. Due to their energy constraints, wireless sensors today communicate occasional short samples or pre-determined summary statistics of the data they collect. This means that computing every additional statistic at high fidelity incurs additional communication and energy overhead. This paper presents Joltik, a framework enabling general, future-proof, and energy-efficient analytics for low power wireless sensors. Joltik is general in that it summarizes sensed data from low-power devices without making assumptions on which specific statistical metric(s) are desired at the cloud and is future-proof, meaning it supports new, unforeseen metrics. Joltik is built upon recent theoretical advances in universal sketching, which can enable a Joltik sensor node to report a compact summary of observed data to enable a large class of statistical summaries. We address key system design and implementation challenges with respect to communication, memory, and computation bottlenecks that arise in practically realizing the potential benefits of universal sketching in the low-power regime. We present a proof-of-concept testbed evaluation of Joltik in LoRaWAN NUCLEO-L476RG boards and sensors. Across a range of realistic datasets, Joltik provides up to a 24.6\texttimes{} reduction in energy cost compared to transmitting raw data and outperforms many natural alternatives (e.g., sub-sampling, custom sketches, compressed sensing, and lossy compression) in terms of energy-accuracy trade-offs.},

abstract = {Advertisers gather data about users and their mobile devices through ads placed within Android and iOS apps. Most of the time, location, device, and app information are linked to the same device using a unique advertising ID (Ad ID). If the Ad ID is not available, advertisers can still use geo-coordinates or IP address to infer links in data gathered from different ad placements.Even though the Ad ID can be disabled by users on both OSes, we demonstrate that advertisers can leave their own unique strings (marks) in the app storage, and use these strings to link information collected from ads. Users cannot clear these marks without losing all data within the app. Because advertising platforms allow connection filtering and geofencing, users who either connect using a non-cellular IP address or allow location access to the app are substantially easier to be rediscovered by the advertiser.We carried out many large-scale experiments on iOS and Android devices involving hundreds of thousands of impressions. We found that on average 49% of impressions from an iOS device, and 59% of Android impressions could be re-identified for less than $5/day per device using this strategy. We subsequently verified this method on 1,727 devices and recovered 660 of them within 48 hours for $86.73. Finally, we explore the behavior of privacy-seeking VPN users. We found that for the majority, their clearnet IP address and location could be unmasked easily using ads.},

abstract = {Facial authentication mechanisms are gaining traction on smartphones because of their convenience and increasingly good performance of face recognition systems. However, mainstream systems use traditional 2D face recognition technologies, which are vulnerable to various spoofing attacks. Existing systems perform liveness detection via specialized hardware, such as infrared dot projectors and dedicated cameras. Although effective, such methods do not align well with the smartphone industry's desire to maximize screen space.This paper presents a new liveness detection system, FaceRevelio, for commodity smartphones with a single front camera. It utilizes the smartphone screen to illuminate a user's face from multiple directions. The facial images captured under varying illumination enable the recovery of the face surface normals via photometric stereo, which can then be integrated into a 3D shape. We leverage the facial depth features of this 3D surface to distinguish a human face from its 2D counterpart. On top of this, we change the screen via a light passcode consisting of a combination of random light patterns to provide security against replay attacks. We evaluate FaceRevelio with 30 users trying to authenticate under various lighting conditions and with a series of 2D spoofing attacks. The results show that using a passcode of 1s, FaceRevelio achieves a mean EER of 1.4% and 0.15% against photo and video attacks, respectively.},

abstract = {We present Quantum Belief Propagation (QBP), a Quantum Annealing (QA) based decoder design for Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) error control codes, which have found many useful applications in Wi-Fi, satellite communications, mobile cellular systems, and data storage systems. QBP reduces the LDPC decoding to a discrete optimization problem, then embeds that reduced design onto quantum annealing hardware. QBP's embedding design can support LDPC codes of block length up to 420 bits on real state-of-the-art QA hardware with 2,048 qubits. We evaluate performance on real quantum annealer hardware, performing sensitivity analyses on a variety of parameter settings. Our design achieves a bit error rate of 10--8 in 20 μs and a 1,500 byte frame error rate of 10--6 in 50 μs at SNR 9 dB over a Gaussian noise wireless channel. Further experiments measure performance over real-world wireless channels, requiring 30 μs to achieve a 1,500 byte 99.99% frame delivery rate at SNR 15-20 dB. QBP achieves a performance improvement over an FPGA based soft belief propagation LDPC decoder, by reaching a bit error rate of 10--8 and a frame error rate of 10--6 at an SNR 2.5--3.5 dB lower. In terms of limitations, QBP currently cannot realize practical protocol-sized (e.g., Wi-Fi, WiMax) LDPC codes on current QA processors. Our further studies in this work present future cost, throughput, and QA hardware trend considerations.},

abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) networking represents a core technology to meet the demanding bandwidth requirements of emerging connected vehicles. However, the feasibility of mmWave vehicle-to-everything (V2X) connectivity has long been questioned. One major doubt lies in how the highly directional mmWave links can sustain under high mobility. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive reality check of mmWave V2X networks. We deploy an experimental testbed to mimic a typical mmWave V2X scenario, and customize a COTS mmWave radio to enable microscopic investigation of the channel and the link. We further construct a high-fidelity 3D ray-tracer to reproduce the mmWave characteristics at scale. With this toolset, we study the mmWave V2X coverage, mobility and blockage, codebook/beam management, and spatial multiplexing. Our measurement debunks some common misperceptions of mmWave V2X networks. In particular, due to the constrained roadway network structures, we find the beam management can be handled easily by the often-denounced beam scanning schemes, as long as the codebook is properly designed. Blockage can be almost eliminated through proper basestation deployment and cooperation. Highly effective spatial multiplexing can be realized even without sophisticated MIMO radios. Our work points to possible ways to realize efficient and reliable mmWave networks under high mobility, while maintaining the simplicity of standard network protocols.},

In this paper, we present SpiroSonic, a new system design that uses commodity smartphones to support complete, accurate yet reliable spirometry tests in regular home settings with various environmental and human factors. SpiroSonic measures the humans' chest wall motion via acoustic sensing and interprets such motion into lung function indices, based on the clinically validated correlation between them. We implemented SpiroSonic as a smartphone app, and verified SpiroSonic's monitoring error over healthy humans as &lt;3%. Clinical studies further show that SpiroSonic reaches 5%-10% monitoring error among 83 pediatric patients.

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices are hindered from communicating with their neighbors by incompatible protocols or electromagnetic interference. Existing solutions adopting physical covert channels have limitations in receiver distinction, additional hardware, conditional placement, or physical contact. Our system, Deaf-Aid, utilizes the stealthy speaker-to-gyroscope channel to build robust protocol-independent communication with automatic receiver identification. Deaf-Aid exploits ultrasonic signals at a frequency corresponding to the target receiver, forcing the gyroscope inside to resonate, so as to convey information. We probe the relationship among axes in a gyroscope to surmount frequency offset ingeniously and support multi-channel communication. Meanwhile, Deaf-Aid identifies the receivers automatically via device fingerprints constituted by the diversity of resonant frequency ranges. Furthermore, we entitle Deaf-Aid the capability of mobile communication which is an essential demand for IoT devices. We address the challenge of accurate signals recovery from motion interference. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Deaf-Aid yields 47bps with BER lower than 1% under motion interference. To our best knowledge, Deaf-Aid is the first work to enable stealthy mobile IoT communication on the basis of inertial motion sensors.},

abstract = {Retailers are aiming to enhance customer experience by automating the checkout process. The key impediment here is the effort to manually align the product barcode with the scanner, requiring sequential handling of items without blocking the line-of-sight of the laser beam. While recent systems such as Amazon Go eliminate human involvement using an extensive array of cameras, we propose a privacy-preserving alternative, RFGo, that identifies products using passive RFID tags. Foregoing continuous monitoring of customers throughout the store, RFGo scans the products in a dedicated checkout area that is large enough for customers to simply walk in and stand until the scan is complete (in two seconds). Achieving such low-latency checkout is not possible with traditional RFID readers, which decode tags using one antenna at a time. To overcome this, RFGo includes a custom-built RFID reader that simultaneously decodes a tag's response from multiple carrier-level synchronized antennas enabling a large set of tag observations in a very short time. RFGo then feeds these observations to a neural network that accurately distinguishes the products within the checkout area from those that are outside. We build a prototype of RFGo and evaluate its performance in challenging scenarios. Our experiments show that RFGo is extremely accurate, fast and well-suited for practical deployment in apparel stores.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a widespread deployment of NB-IoT networks for massive machine-to-machine communication in the emerging 5G era. Unfortunately, the key aspects of NB-IoT networks, such as radio access performance and power consumption have not been well-understood due to lack of effective tools and closed nature of operational cellular infrastructure. In this paper, we develop NB-Scope - the first hardware NB-IoT diagnostic tool that supports fine-grained fusion of power and protocol traces. We then conduct a large-scale field measurement study consisting of 30 nodes deployed at over 1,200 locations in 3 regions during a period of three months. Our in-depth analysis of the collected 49 GB traces showed that NB-IoT nodes yield significantly imbalanced energy consumption in the wild, up to a ratio of 75:1, which may lead to short battery lifetime and frequent network partition. Such a high performance variance can be attributed to several key factors including diverse network coverage levels, long tail power profile, and excessive control message repetitions. We then explore the optimization of NB-IoT base station settings on a software-defined eNodeB testbed, and suggest several important design aspects that can be considered by future NB-IoT specifications and chipsets.},

We intend to play 3D audio-annotations in the user's ears as she moves and looks at AAR objects in the environment. While companies like Bose and Microsoft are beginning to release such capabilities, they are intended for outdoor environments. Our system aims to explore the challenges indoors, without requiring any infrastructure deployment. Our core idea is two-fold. (1) We jointly use the inertial sensors (IMUs) in earphones and smartphones to estimate a user's indoor location and gazing orientation. (2) We play 3D sounds in the earphones and exploit the human's responses to (re)calibrate errors in location and orientation. We believe this fusion of IMU and acoustics is novel, and could be an important step towards indoor AAR. Our system, Ear-AR, is tested on 7 volunteers invited to an AAR exhibition - like a museum - that we set up in our building's lobby and lab. Across 60 different test sessions, the volunteers browsed different subsets of 24 annotated objects as they walked around. Results show that Ear-AR plays the correct audio-annotations with good accuracy. The user-feedback is encouraging and points to further areas of research and applications.},

abstract = {We present GROOT, a mobile volumetric video streaming system that delivers three-dimensional data to mobile devices for a fully immersive virtual and augmented reality experience. The system design for streaming volumetric videos should be fundamentally different from conventional 2D video streaming systems. First, the amount of data required to deliver the 3D volume is considerably larger than conventional videos with frames of 2D images, even compared to high-resolution 2D or 360° videos. Second, the 3D data representation, which encodes the surface of objects within the volume, is a sparse and unorganized data structure with varying scales, whereas a conventional video is composed of a sequence of images with the fixed-size 2D grid structure. GROOT is a streaming framework with a novel data structure that enables not only real-time transmission and decoding on mobile devices but also continuous on-demand user view adaptation. Specifically, we modify the conventional octree to introduce the independence of leaf nodes with minimal memory overhead, which enables parallel decoding of highly irregular 3D data. We also developed a suite of techniques to compress color information and filter out 3D points outside of a user's view, which efficiently minimizes the data size and decoding cost. Our extensive evaluation shows that GROOT achieves more stable but faster frame rates compared to any previous method to stream and visualize volumetric videos on mobile devices.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen dramatic advances in low-power neural accelerators that aim to bring deep learning analytics to IoT devices; simultaneously, there have been considerable advances in the design of low-power radios to enable efficient compute offload from IoT devices to the cloud. Neither is a panacea --- deep learning models are often too large for low-power accelerators and bandwidth needs are often too high for low-power radios. While there has been considerable work on deep learning for smartphone-class devices, these methods do not work well for small battery-powered IoT devices that are considerably more resource-constrained.In this paper, we bridge this gap by designing a continuously tunable method for leveraging both local and remote resources to optimize performance of a deep learning model. Clio presents a novel approach to split machine learning models between an IoT device and cloud in a progressive manner that adapts to wireless dynamics. We show that this method can be combined with model compression and adaptive model partitioning to create an integrated system for IoT-cloud partitioning. We implement Clio on the GAP8 low-power neural accelerator, provide an exhaustive characterization of the operating regimes where each method performs best and show that Clio can enable graceful performance degradation as resources diminish.},

abstract = {We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of μmedIC, a fully-integrated wireless and batteryless micro-implanted sensor. The sensor powers up by harvesting energy from RF signals and communicates at near-zero power via backscatter. In contrast to prior designs which cannot operate across various in-body environments, our sensor can self-reconfigure to adapt to different tissues and channel conditions. This adaptation is made possible by two key innovations: a reprogrammable antenna that can tune its energy harvesting resonance to surrounding tissues, and a backscatter rate adaptation protocol that closes the feedback loop by tracking circuit-level sensor hints.We built our design on millimeter-sized integrated chips and flexible antenna substrates, and tested it in environments that span both in-vitro (fluids) and ex-vivo (tissues) conditions. Our evaluation demonstrates μmedIC's ability to tune its energy harvesting resonance by more than 200 MHz (i.e., adapt to different tissues) and to scale its bitrate by an order of magnitude up to 6Mbps, allowing it to support higher data rate applications (such as streaming low-res images) without sacrificing availability. This rate adaptation also allows μmedIC to scale its energy consumption by an order of magnitude down to 350 nanoWatts. These capabilities pave way for a new generation of networked micro-implants that can adapt to complex and time-varying in-body environments.},

abstract = {Map matching for cellular data is to transform a sequence of cell tower locations to a trajectory on a road map. It is an essential processing step for many applications, such as traffic optimization and human mobility analysis. However, most current map matching approaches are based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) that have heavy computation overhead to consider high-order cell tower information. This paper presents a fast map matching framework for cellular data, named as DMM, which adopts a recurrent neural network (RNN) to identify the most-likely trajectory of roads given a sequence of cell towers. Once the RNN model is trained, it can process cell tower sequences as making RNN inference, resulting in fast map matching speed. To transform DMM into a practical system, several challenges are addressed by developing a set of techniques, including spatial-aware representation of input cell tower sequences, an encoder-decoder framework for map matching model with variable-length input and output, and a reinforcement learning based model for optimizing the matched outputs. Extensive experiments on a large-scale anonymized cellular dataset reveal that DMM provides high map matching accuracy (precision 80.43% and recall 85.42%) and reduces the average inference time of HMM-based approaches by 46.58\texttimes{}.},

abstract = {We present the first system that can airdrop wireless sensors from small drones and live insects. In addition to the challenges of achieving low-power consumption and long-range communication, airdropping wireless sensors is difficult because it requires the sensor to survive the impact when dropped in mid-air. Our design takes inspiration from nature: small insects like ants can fall from tall buildings and survive because of their tiny mass and size. Inspired by this, we design insect-scale wireless sensors that come fully integrated with an onboard power supply and a lightweight mechanical actuator to detach from the aerial platform. Our system introduces a first-of-its-kind 37 mg mechanical release mechanism to drop the sensor during flight, using only 450 μJ of energy as well as a wireless communication link that can transmit sensor data at 33 kbps up to 1 km. Once deployed, our 98 mg wireless sensor can run for 1.3-2.5 years when transmitting 10-50 packets per hour on a 68 mg battery. We demonstrate attachment to a small 28 mm wide drone and a moth (Manduca sexta) and show that our insect-scale sensors flutter as they fall, suffering no damage on impact onto a tile floor from heights of 22 m.},

abstract = {The seismocardiogram (SCG) is a recording of a human heart's mechanical activity. It captures fine-grained cardiovascular events such as the opening and closing of heart valves and the contraction and relaxation of heart chambers. Today, SCG recordings are obtained by strapping an accelerometer at the apex of the heart to measure chest wall vibrations. These recordings can be used to diagnose and monitor various cardiovascular conditions including myocardial infarction (heart attack), coronary heart disease, and ischemia.This paper introduces RF-SCG, a system that can capture SCG recordings without requiring any contact with the human body. The system operates by analyzing the reflections of millimeter-wave radar signals off the human body. RF-SCG can reconstruct the SCG waveform, and it can time 5 cardiovascular events within individual heartbeats with high accuracy. Our design is based on a hybrid architecture that combines signal processing with deep learning. The pipeline includes a 4D Cardiac Beamformer that can focus on the reflections of the human heart and a deep learning pipeline (RF-to-SCG Translator) that can transform these reflections into SCG waveforms. Empirical evaluation with 40,000 heartbeats from 21 healthy subjects demonstrates RF-SCG's ability to robustly time five key cardiovascular events (aortic valve opening, aortic valve closing, mitral valve opening, mitral valve closing, and isovolumetric contraction) with a median error between 0.26%-1.29%.},

Through a MIMO array of phased arrays with hundreds of antenna elements, mmWave can boost wireless bit-rates to 100+ Gbps, and potentially achieve near-vision sensing resolution. However, the lack of an experimental platform has been impeding research in this field. We propose to fill the gap with M3 (M-Cube), the first mmWave massive MIMO software radio. M3 features a fully reconfigurable array of phased arrays, with up to 8 RF chains and 256 antenna elements. Despite the orders of magnitude larger antenna arrays, its cost is orders of magnitude lower, even when compared with state-of-the-art single RF chain mmWave software radios. In this demo, we will show M3's hardware modules, and demonstrate its usage in mmWave MIMO communication and sensing.},

WhiteHaul features a custom-designed frequency conversion substrate that efficiently handles multiple noncontiguous chunks of TVWS spectrum using multiple low-cost COTS 802.11n/ac cards but with a single antenna. At the software layer, WhiteHaul uses MPTCP as a link-level tunnel abstraction to efficiently aggregate multiple chunks of the TVWS spectrum via a novel uncoupled, cross-layer congestion control algorithm. This demo illustrates the unique features of the WhiteHaul system based on a prototype implementation employing a modified version of MPTCP Linux Kernel and a custom-designed conversion substrate. Using this prototype, we highlight the performance of the WhiteHaul system under various configurations and network conditions.},

We use COTS WiFi hardware in combination with a self-developed beamforming module and novel algorithms for the HDA approach, leveraging the MU-MIMO precoding of the WiFi system. The implemented control and signal processing software is fully transparent to the WiFi part, i.e., no protocol changes are needed.

However, SD-RAN so far remained limited to a mere reconfiguration of the base station. In this work, we demonstrate a prototype of a service-oriented RAN on top of the OpenAirInterface and Mosaic5G platforms that brings programmability and extensibility to the RAN with a range of network applications for the purpose of intelligent slicing. We implemented a slice control and management framework, and plug a traffic analysis application that significantly improves the performance of slice users. We observe an improvement of 30% in application round-trip time with negligible variability for the considered traffic. Further, we demonstrate how to extend control plane functionality from a network store to improve slice performance.},

This work focuses on the last leg of such delivery: physically approaching a customer's landing zone. This has traditionally relied on a combination of GPS and computer-vision to locate and identify a landing zone. Instead of using computer vision, we propose to use ultra-wideband beacons (UWB) to assist in the landing process. The UAV's location relative to the landing zone is continuously measured based on the wireless propagation delay between the UAV and the landing zone's corners. We show that a single pair of wireless devices, one at the UAV and one at the landing zone, suffices to obtain the UAV's location. The landing zone's UWB device, connected to multiple antennas, receives multiple copies of the UAV's signals, that enables a sub-decimeter 3D-localization of the UAV. This helps the UAV's control logic governing the approach and landing process.},

We then propose Aquilo to bring temperature-awareness in mmWave networks; Aquilo maintains relatively high throughput performance and cools down the devices substantially. Our testbed experiments in static conditions show that Aquilo reaches a median peak temperature just 1°C above the optimal with less than 10% throughput sacrifice only.},

We then devise algorithms for constructing 3D coverage map simultaneously with real-time airborne missions in a cost-effective manner.},

abstract = {Emotions show high significance on human health. Automatic emotion recognition is helpful for monitoring psychological disorders, mental problems and exploring behavioral mechanisms. Existing approaches adopt costly and bulky specialized hardware such as EEG/ECG helmet, possess privacy risks, or with low accuracy and user experience. With the increasing popularity of wearables, people tend to equip multiple smart devices, which provides potential opportunity for emotion perception. In this paper, we present a pervasive and portable system called MW-Emotion to recognize common emotional states with multi-modal wearable devices. However, ubiquitous wearable devices perceive shallow information which is not obviously related to human emotions. MW-Emotion excavates intrinsic mapping relationship between emotions and sensing data. Our experiments show that MW-Emotion can recognize different emotion states with a relatively high accuracy of 83.1%.},

abstract = {Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are the industrial control systems and operational infrastructure that can monitor and control the electricity grid. Electricity grids are increasingly transforming from the one-directional way of generating, transmitting, and distributing electricity to smart grids that are multi-directional in the way they monitor, automate, and remotely operate the power sector. SCADA systems are increasingly under cyber attacks illustrating growing vulnerabilities to the smart grids. The U.S. power industry notes the importance of SCADA chain cyber risks and the need to take proactive measures (timely patching of vulnerabilities) to mitigate the risks. However, not all vulnerabilities are always exploited by attackers; and not all vulnerabilities can be patched in resource-constrained scenarios. Therefore, the patch sequence needs to be strategic and efficient.In this poster, we address the critical need to prioritize patching the smart grid SCADA systems on time. This is even more prominent with the advent of new technologies, usage of backup systems, updated standards, and new regulations on the safety and security of the smart grid. In this direction, we present SmartPatch - a patch prioritization method to address patch sequencing of the SCADA chain in the smart grid systems. It analyzes the possible attacker behavior as well as system criticality using game theory for decision making. It provides a patch prioritization strategy that is cost-constrained and reduces the impact of the possible attacks to a large extent.},

In this study, we propose ScreenID, for enhancing the QR code security by identifying its authenticity, which embeds a QR code with information of unique screen fingerprint - PWM frequency. PWM frequencies are adjusted to different values by screen manufacturers, therefore can successfully differentiate screens. To improve the estimation accuracy of PWM frequency, ScreenID incorporates a model for the interaction between the camera and screen in the temporal and spatial domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ScreenID can differentiate screens of different models, types and manufacturers and thus improve the security of QR codes.},

abstract = {Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is an emerging architecture that supports ultra-low latency and high-bandwidth services by deploying servers at the edge of the network to provide computing and storage resources. Recent studies tend to combine (Network Function Virtualization) NFV with MEC and deploy (Virtualized Network Functions) VNFs on MEC servers to achieve fast access to the edge user equipment (UE). However, to guarantee the QoS requirements of mobile users, it is necessary to migrate VNFs to an advisable edge server when users move across Base Stations (BS). How to choose the target BS for VNFs migration? How to select the path for VNF data migration? How to ensure the QoS of user services during the migration process? To solve these issues, we study the seamless VNFs migration problem in mobile edge networks and formulate it as an ILP model, which aims to minimize the migration delay and cost. Then we propose a migration algorithm based on Dijkstra (MBD) to obtain the migration destination BS and migration paths. We implement the mathematical model in Gurobi and design a Greedy algorithm to compare the performance with the MBD algorithm. The experiment results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.},

In MEC-NFV networks, network services are deployed in the form of service function chains (SFCs), each consisting of an ordered set of virtual network functions (VNFs). In this paper, we focus on the VNF placement problem in MEC-NFV enabled networks, aiming to optimize the throughput of SFC requests (SFCRs). First, we involve the sharing mechanism of VNF instances in the problem formulations, which can improve network resource utilization and save more node resources. Then we formulate the problem mathematically and propose a correlation-based mapping algorithm to map SFCRs in the network. Moreover, we design an adjustment algorithm to optimize the mapped SFCRs. Evaluation results show that our proposed solution efficiently improves the throughput of SFCRs compared with the benchmarks.},

In such application domains, it is essential to keep information fresh, as outdated information loses its value and can lead to system failures and safety risks. The Age of Information (AoI) is a performance metric that captures how fresh the information is from the perspective of the destination. In this paper, we show that as the congestion in the wireless network increases, the AoI degrades sharply, leading to outdated information at the destination. Leveraging years of theoretical research, we propose and implement WiFresh: an unconventional architecture that achieves near optimal information freshness in wireless networks, regardless of the level of congestion. Our experimental results show that WiFresh can improve information freshness by two orders of magnitude when compared to an equivalent standard WiFi network.},

BurstTracker is driven by our discovery that the proprietary LTE downlink schedulers running on LTE base stations allocate resources to users in a way that reveals if a user's downlink queue runs empty during a download. We demonstrate that BurstTracker works across Tier-1 cellular providers and across a variety of network conditions. We also present a case study that shows how application developers can use this tool in practice. Surprisingly, with BurstTracker, we find that the LTE downlink may not be the bottleneck for video streaming on several Tier-1 providers, even during peak hours at busy locations. Rather, transparent TCP middleboxes deployed by these providers lead to downlink underutilization, because they force Slow-Start Restart. With a simple workaround, we improve video streaming bitrate on busy LTE links by 35%.},

abstract = {An ultrasonic Positioning System (UPS) has outperformed RF-based systems in terms of its accuracy for years. However, few of the developed solutions have been deployed in practice to satisfy the localization demand of today's smart devices, which lack ultrasonic sensors and were considered as being "deaf'' to ultrasound. A recent finding demonstrates that ultrasound may be audible to the smart devices under certain conditions due to their microphone's nonlinearity. Inspired by this insight, this work revisits the ultrasonic positioning technique and builds a practical UPS, called UPS+, for ultrasound-incapable smart devices. The core concept is to deploy two types of indoor beacon devices, which will advertise ultrasonic beacons at two different ultrasonic frequencies respectively. Their superimposed beacons are shifted to a low-frequency by virtue of the nonlinearity effect at the receiver's microphone. This underlying property functions as an implicit ultrasonic downconverter without throwing harm to the hearing system of humans. We demonstrate UPS+, a fully functional UPS prototype, with centimeter-level localization accuracy using custom-made beacon hardware and well-designed algorithms.},

abstract = {Full-duplex (FD) wireless can significantly enhance spectrum efficiency but requires tremendous amount of self-interference (SI) cancellation. Recent advances in the RFIC community enabled wideband RF SI cancellation (SIC) in integrated circuits (ICs) via frequency-domain equalization (FDE), where RF filters channelize the SI signal path. Unlike other FD implementations, that mostly rely on delay lines, FDE-based cancellers can be realized in small-form-factor devices. However, the fundamental limits and higher layer challenges associated with these cancellers were not explored yet. Therefore, and in order to support the integration with a software-defined radio (SDR) and to facilitate experimentation in a testbed with several nodes, we design and implement an FDE-based RF canceller on a printed circuit board (PCB). We derive and experimentally validate the PCB canceller model and present a canceller configuration scheme based on an optimization problem. We then extensively evaluate the performance of the FDE-based FD radio in the SDR testbed. Experiments show that it achieves 95dB overall SIC (52dB from RF SIC) across 20MHz bandwidth, and an average link-level FD gain of 1.87x. We also conduct experiments in: (i) uplink-downlink networks with inter-user interference, and (ii) heterogeneous networks with half-duplex and FD users. The experimental FD gains in the two types of networks confirm previous analytical results. They depend on the users' SNR values and the number of FD users, and are 1.14x-1.25x and 1.25x-1.73x, respectively. Finally, we numerically evaluate and compare the RFIC and PCB implementations and study various design tradeoffs.},

Few have been as contentious as the Google-initiated Accelerated Mobile Project (AMP), both praised for its seemingly instant mobile web experience and criticized based on concerns about the enforcement of its formats. This paper presents the first characterization of AMP's impact on users' QoE. We do this using a corpus of over 2,100 AMP webpages, and their corresponding non-AMP counterparts, based on trendy-keyword-based searches. We characterized AMP's impact looking at common web QoE metrics, including Page Load Time, Time to First Byte and SpeedIndex (SI). Our results show that AMP significantly improves SI, yielding on average a 60% lower SI than non-AMP pages without accounting for prefetching. Prefetching of AMP pages pushes this advantage even further, with prefetched pages loading over 2,000ms faster than non-prefetched AMP pages. This clear boost may come, however, at a non-negligible cost for users with limited data plans as it incurs an average of over 1.4~MB of additional data downloaded, unbeknownst to users.},

Using mechanical drones to move sensors, however, severely limits operation time since flight time is limited by the energy density of current battery technology. We explore an alternative, biology-based solution: integrate sensing, computing and communication functionalities onto live flying insects to create a mobile IoT platform. Such an approach takes advantage of these tiny, highly efficient biological insects which are ubiquitous in many outdoor ecosystems, to essentially provide mobility for free. Doing so however requires addressing key technical challenges of power, size, weight and self-localization in order for the insects to perform location-dependent sensing operations as they carry our IoT payload through the environment. We develop and deploy our platform on bumblebees which includes backscatter communication, low-power self-localization hardware, sensors, and a power source. We show that our platform is capable of sensing, backscattering data at 1 kbps when the insects are back at the hive, and localizing itself up to distances of 80 m from the access points, all within a total weight budget of 102 mg.},

abstract = {Client devices must cooperate to share limited resources in wireless local area networks (WLANs). Standards exist for access points (APs), to use a more holistic view of the RF environment, to share information with clients (802.11v/k), allowing clients to make better performance-impacting decisions, e.g. choosing to roam between APs. Standards intended to lower the cost of these expensive control-plane operations (802.11r) also exist. In this paper, we use large scale measurements to show the limited adoption of existing client-based techniques. We propose ClientMarshal for enterprise WLANs, which provides network infrastructure more control over these decisions without modification to client device software. ClientMarshal divides the enterprise network into logical groups called cells, each consisting of a small number of neighboring APs operating on different channels. All APs belonging to the same cell broadcast the same wireless identity (BSSID) to client devices, and appear as a single virtual AP. The key enabler behind ClientMarshal is FreeSteer (FST), a novel protocol we develop that allows an AP to dynamically steer an associated client to another AP in the same cell based on various network measurements in order to improve overall network performance. This design also improves the roaming experience by bypassing traditional control-plane operations, avoiding significant overhead as well as client implementation defects. Using systematic evaluation and implementation on commodity APs, we show the efficacy and control of FST protocol in client steering. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, FST can steer clients almost 2.5X faster, with 52% higher success rate, and reduce packet loss by more than 68%.},

abstract = {LTE test cases are standardized by 3GPP. They must be executed on every LTE-capable device model before commercial release. In this work, we examine the LTE testing practices in terms of completeness and efficiency. We discover that the standardized tests are incomplete in that a number of test cases related to multiple protocol interactions are missing. Our analysis also shows that, the isolated treatment of test cases, but not from the system perspective, incurs repetitive executions of test operations, thus resulting in testing inefficiencies. We thus make a case for a paradigm shift from ad hoc testing to a methodical approach to LTE testing. We follow a few guidelines from the LTE standards and propose an algorithmic approach to systematic testing. In the process, we address various challenges, provide complete list of test cases, and present the related algorithms. Our evaluation shows that, by eliminating repetitive operations, our new scheme reduces up to 70% of LTE testing steps. We also find 87 new, yet valid test cases that are not defined by the LTE standards.},

abstract = {Wi-Fi localization and tracking face accuracy limitations dictated by antenna count (for angle-of-arrival methods) and frequency bandwidth (for time-of-arrival methods). This paper presents mD-Track, a device-free Wi-Fi tracking system capable of jointly fusing information from as many dimensions as possible to overcome the resolution limit of each individual dimension. Through a novel path separation algorithm, mD-Track can resolve multipath at a much finer-grained resolution, isolating signals reflected off targets of interest. mD-Track can localize human passively at a high accuracy with just a single Wi-Fi transceiver pair. mD-Track also introduces novel methods to greatly streamline its estimation algorithms, achieving real-time operation. We implement mD-Track on both WARP and cheap off-the-shelf commodity Wi-Fi hardware, and evaluate its performance in different indoor environments.},

abstract = {Due to the ever-growing concerns on the air pollution and energy security, many cities have started to update their taxi fleets with electric ones. Although environmentally friendly, the rapid promotion of electric taxis raises problems to both taxi drivers and governments, e.g., prolonged waiting/charging time, unbalanced utilization of charging infrastructures and reduced taxi supply due to the long charging time. In this paper, we make the first effort to understand the long-term evolving patterns through a five-year study on one of the largest electric taxi networks in the world, i.e., the Shenzhen electric taxi network in China. In particular, we perform a comprehensive measurement investigation called ePat to explore the evolving mobility and charging patterns of electric vehicles. Our ePat is based on 4.8 TB taxi GPS data, 240 GB taxi transaction data, and metadata from 117 charging stations, during an evolving process from 427 electric taxis in 2013 to 13,178 in 2018. Moreover, ePat also explores the impacts of various contexts and benefits during the evolving process. Our ePat as a comprehensive investigation of the electric taxi network mobility and charging evolving has the potential to advance the understanding of the evolving patterns of electric taxi networks and pave the way for analyzing future shared autonomous vehicles.},

abstract = {MP-H2 is a client-only, HTTP-based multipath solution. It enables an HTTP client to fetch content (an HTTP object) over multiple network paths such as WiFi and cellular on smartphones. Compared to MPTCP, MP-H2 offers several key advantages including server transparency, middlebox compatibility, and friendliness to CDN, anycast, and load balancing. MP-H2 strategically splits the file into byte range requests sent over multipath, and dynamically balances the workload across all paths. Furthermore, MP-H2 leverages new features in HTTP/2 including stream multiplexing, flow control, and application-layer PING to boost the performance. MP-H2 also supports multi-homing where each path contacts a different CDN server for enhanced performance. Evaluations show that MP-H2 offers only slightly degraded performance (6% on average) while being much easier to deploy compared to MPTCP. Compared to other state-of-the-art HTTP multipath solutions, MP-H2 reduces the file download time by up to 47%, and increases the DASH video streaming bitrate by up to 44%.},

However, almost all existing works (e.g., based on cellphones, onboard devices, or traffic cameras) suffer from high costs, low penetration rates, or only aggregate results. To address these drawbacks, we utilize Electric Toll Collection systems (ETC) as a large-scale sensor network and design a system called VeMo to transparently model and predict vehicle mobility at the individual level with a full penetration rate. Our novelty is how we address uncertainty issues (i.e., unknown routes and speeds) due to sparse implicit ETC data based on a key data-driven insight, i.e., individual driving behaviors are strongly correlated with crowds of drivers under certain spatiotemporal contexts and can be predicted by combining both personal habits and context information. More importantly, we evaluate VeMo with (i) a large-scale ETC system with tracking devices at 773 highway entrances and exits capturing more than 2 million vehicles every day; (ii) a fleet consisting of 114 thousand vehicles with GPS data as ground truth. We compared VeMo with state-of-the-art benchmark mobility models, and the experimental results show that VeMo outperforms them by average 10% in terms of accuracy.},

SolarGest is based on the observation that each gesture interferes with incident light rays on the solar panel in a unique way, leaving its distinguishable signature in harvested photocurrent. Using solar energy harvesting laws, we develop a model to optimize design and usage of SolarGest. To further improve the robustness of SolarGest under non-deterministic operating conditions, we combine dynamic time warping with Z-score transformation in a signal processing pipeline to pre-process each gesture waveform before it is analyzed for classification. We evaluate SolarGest with both conventional opaque solar cells as well as emerging see-through transparent cells. Our experiments with 6,960 gesture samples for 6 different gestures reveal that even with transparent cells, SolarGest can detect 96% of the gestures while consuming 44% less power compared to light sensor based systems.},

abstract = {Overheating smartphones could hamper user experiences. While there have been numerous reports on smartphone overheating, a systematic measurement and user experience study on the thermal aspect of smartphones is missing. Using thermal imaging cameras, we measure and analyze the temperatures of various smartphones running diverse application workloads such as voice calling, video recording, video chatting, and 3D online gaming. Our experiments show that running popular applications such as video chat, could raise the smartphone's surface temperature to over 50$^circ$C in only 10 minutes, which could easily cause thermal pain to users. Recent ubiquitous scenarios such as augmented reality and mobile deep learning also have considerable thermal issues. We then perform a user study to examine when the users perceive heat discomfort from the smartphones and how they react to overheating. Most of our user study participants reported considerable thermal discomfort while playing a mobile game, and that overheating disrupted interaction flows. With this in mind, we devise a smartphone surface temperature prediction model, by using only system statistics and internal sensor values. Our evaluation showed high prediction accuracy with root-mean-square errors of less than 2$^circ$C. We discuss several insights from our findings and recommendations for user experience, OS design, and developer support for better user-thermal interactions.},

abstract = {The popularity of 4K videos has grown significantly in the past few years. Yet coding and streaming live 4K videos incurs prohibitive cost to the network and end system. Motivated by this observation, we explore the feasibility of supporting live 4K video streaming over wireless networks using commodity devices. Given the high data rate requirement of 4K videos, 60 GHz is appealing, but its large and unpredictable throughput fluctuation makes it hard to provide desirable user experience. In particular, to support live 4K video streaming, we should (i) adapt to highly variable and unpredictable wireless throughput, (ii) support efficient 4K video coding on commodity devices. To this end, we propose a novel system, Jigsaw. It consists of (i) easy-to-compute layered video coding to seamlessly adapt to unpredictable wireless link fluctuations, (ii) efficient GPU implementation of video coding on commodity devices, and (iii) effectively leveraging both WiFi and WiGig through delayed video adaptation and smart scheduling. Using real experiments and emulation, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our system. Our results show that it improves PSNR by 6-15dB and improves SSIM by 0.011-0.217 over state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, even when throughput fluctuates widely between 0.2Gbps-2Gbps, it can achieve an average PSNR of 33dB.},

abstract = {The automotive industry is increasingly employing software- based solutions to provide value-added features on vehicles, especially with the coming era of electric vehicles and autonomous driving. The ever-increasing cyber components of vehicles (i.e., computation, communication, and control), however, incur new risks of anomalies, as demonstrated by the millions of vehicles recalled by different manufactures. To mitigate these risks, we design B-Diag, a battery-based diagnostics system that guards vehicles against anomalies with a cyber-physical approach, and implement B-Diag as an add-on module of commodity vehicles attached to automotive batteries, thus providing vehicles an additional layer of protection. B-Diag is inspired by the fact that the automotive battery operates in strong dependency with many physical components of the vehicle, which is observable as correlations between battery voltage and the vehicle's corresponding operational parameters, e.g., a faster revolutions-per-minute (RPM) of the engine, in general, leads to a higher battery voltage. B-Diag exploits such physically-induced correlations to diagnose vehicles by cross-validating the vehicle information with battery voltage, based on a set of data-driven norm models constructed online. Such a design of B-Diag is steered by a dataset collected with a prototype system when driving a 2018 Subaru Crosstrek in real-life over 3 months, covering a total mileage of about 1, 400 miles. Besides the Crosstrek, we have also evaluated B-Diag with driving traces of a 2008 Honda Fit, a 2018 Volvo XC60, and a 2017 Volkswagen Passat, showing B-Diag detects vehicle anomalies with &gt;86% (up to 99%) averaged detection rate.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the progressive loss of dopaminergic nerve cells. People with PD usually demonstrate deficits in performing basic daily activities, and the relevant annual social cost can reach about $25 billion in the United States. Early detection of PD plays an important role in symptom relief and improvement in the performance of activities in daily life (ADL), which eventually reduces societal and economic burden. However, conventional PD detection methods are inconvenient in daily life (e.g., requiring users to wear sensors). To overcome this challenge, we propose and identify the non-speech body sounds as the new PD biomarker, and utilize the data in smartphone usage to realize the passive PD detection in daily life without interrupting the user. Specifically, we present PDVocal, an end-to-end smartphone-based privacy-preserving system towards early PD detection. PDVocal can passively recognize the PD digital biomarkers in the voice data during daily phone conversation. At the user end, PDVocal filters the audio stream and only extracts the non-speech body sounds (e.g., breathing, clearing throat and swallowing) which contain no privacy-sensitive content. At the cloud end, PDVocal analyzes the body sounds of interest and assesses the health condition using a customized residual network. For the sake of reliability in real-world PD detection, we investigate the method of the performance optimizer including an opportunistic learning knob and a long-term tracking protocol. We evaluate our proposed PDVocal on a collected dataset from 890 participants and real-life conversations from publicly available data sources. Results indicate that non-speech body sounds are a promising digital biomarker for privacy-preserving PD detection in daily life.},

abstract = {Smart wristband has become a dominant device in the wearable ecosystem, providing versatile functions such as fitness tracking, mobile payment, and transport ticketing. However, the small form-factor, low-profile hardware interfaces and computational resources limit their capabilities in security checking. Many wristband devices have recently witnessed alarming vulnerabilities, e.g., personal data leakage and payment fraud, due to the lack of authentication and access control. To fill this gap, we propose a secure text pin input system, namely Taprint, which extends a virtual number pad on the back of a user's hand. Taprint builds on the key observation that the hand "landmarks'', especially finger knuckles, bear unique vibration characteristics when being tapped by the user herself. It thus uses the tapping vibrometry as biometrics to authenticate the user, while distinguishing the tapping locations. Taprint reuses the inertial measurement unit in the wristband, "overclocks'' its sampling rate to extrapolate fine-grained features, and further refines the features to enhance the uniqueness and reliability. Extensive experiments on 128 users demonstrate that Taprint achieves a high accuracy (96%) of keystrokes recognition. It can authenticate users, even through a single-tap, at extremely low error rate (2.4%), and under various practical usage disturbances.},

However, they also pose unprecedented challenges in delivering seamless Internet service for on-board passengers. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale active-passive measurement study of TCP performance over LTE on HSR. Our measurement targets the HSR routes in China operating at above 300 km/h. We performed extensive data collection through both controlled setting and passive monitoring, obtaining 1732.9 GB data collected over 135719 km of trips. Leveraging such a unique dataset, we measure important performance metrics such as TCP goodput, latency, loss rate, as well as key characteristics of TCP flows, application breakdown, and users' behaviors. We further quantitatively study the impact of frequent cellular handover on HSR networking performance, and conduct in-depth examination of the performance of two widely deployed transport-layer protocols: TCP CUBIC and TCP BBR. Our findings reveal the performance of today's commercial HSR networks "in the wild'', as well as identify several performance inefficiencies, which motivate us to design a simple yet effective congestion control algorithm based on BBR to further boost the throughput by up to 36.5%. They together highlight the need to develop dedicated protocol mechanisms that are friendly to extreme mobility.},

abstract = {Playing Android games on Windows x86 PCs has gained enormous popularity in recent years, and the de facto solution is to use mobile emulators built with the AOVB (Android-x86 On VirtualBox) architecture. When playing heavy 3D Android games with AOVB, however, users often suffer unsatisfactory smoothness due to the considerable overhead of full virtualization. This paper presents DAOW, a game-oriented Android emulator implementing the idea of direct Android emulation, which eliminates the overhead of full virtualization by directly executing Android app binaries on top of x86-based Windows. Based on pragmatic, efficient instruction rewriting and syscall emulation, DAOW offers foreign Android binaries direct access to the domestic PC hardware through Windows kernel interfaces, achieving nearly native hardware performance. Moreover, it leverages graphics and security techniques to enhance user experiences and prevent cheating in gaming. As of late 2018, DAOW has been adopted by over 50 million PC users to run thousands of heavy 3D Android games. Compared with AOVB, DAOW improves the smoothness by 21% on average, decreases the game startup time by 48%, and reduces the memory usage by 22%.},

abstract = {In this paper, we for the first time demonstrate how to enable OFDMA in Wi-Fi backscatter for capacity and concurrency enhancement. With our approach, the excitation signal is reflected, modulated and shifted to lie in the frequency band of the OFDM subcarrier by the tag; OFDMA is realized by coordinating tags to convey information to the receiver with orthogonal subcarriers concurrently through backscatter. The crux of the design is to achieve strict synchronization among communication components, which is more challenging than in regular OFDMA systems due to the more prominent hardware diversity and uncertainty for backscattering. We reveal how the subtle asychnronization scenarios particularly for backscattering can incur system offsets, and present a series of novel designs for the excitation signal transmitter, tag, and receiver to address the issue. We build a prototype in 802.11g OFDM framework to validate our design. Experimental results show that our system can achieve 5.2-16Mbps aggregate throughput by allowing 48 tags to transmit concurrently, which is 1.45-5x capacity and 48x concurrency compared with the existing design respectively. We also design an OFDMA tag IC, and the simulation and numerical analysis results show that the tag's power consumption is in tens of μW.},

abstract = {Providing secure communications between wireless devices that encounter each other on an ad-hoc basis is a challenge that has not yet been fully addressed. In these cases, close physical proximity among devices that have never shared a secret key is sometimes used as a basis of trust; devices in close proximity are deemed trustworthy while more distant devices are viewed as potential adversaries. Because radio waves are invisible, however, a user may believe a wireless device is communicating with a nearby device when in fact the user's device is communicating with a distant adversary. Researchers have previously proposed methods for multi-antenna devices to ascertain physical proximity with other devices, but devices with a single antenna, such as those commonly used in the Internet of Things, cannot take advantage of these techniques.We present theoretical and practical evaluation of a method called SNAP -- SiNgle Antenna Proximity -- that allows a single-antenna Wi-Fi device to quickly determine proximity with another Wi-Fi device. Our proximity detection technique leverages the repeating nature Wi-Fi's preamble and the behavior of a signal in a transmitting antenna's near-field region to detect proximity with high probability; SNAP never falsely declares proximity at ranges longer than 14 cm.},

abstract = {People use their mobile devices anywhere and anytime to run various apps, and the information shown on their device screens can be seen by nearby (unauthorized) parties, called shoulder surfers. To mitigate this privacy threat, we have developed HideScreen by utilizing the human vision and optical system properties to hide the users' on-screen information from the shoulder surfers.Specifically, HideScreen discretizes the device screen into grid patterns to neutralize the low-frequency components so that the on-screen information will "blend into'' the background when viewed from the outside of the designed range. We have developed and evaluated several ways of hiding both on-screen texts and images from shoulder surfers. Our extensive experimental evaluation of HideScreen demonstrates its high protection rates (&gt;96% for texts and &gt;99% for images) while providing good user experience.},

abstract = {This paper presents TouchAuth, a new touch-to-access device authentication approach using induced body electric potentials (iBEPs) caused by the indoor ambient electric field that is mainly emitted from the building's electrical cabling. The design of TouchAuth is based on the electrostatics of iBEP generation and a resulting property, i.e., the iBEPs at two close locations on the same human body are similar, whereas those from different human bodies are distinct. Extensive experiments verify the above property and show that TouchAuth achieves high-profile receiver operating characteristics in implementing the touch-to-access policy. Our experiments also show that a range of possible interfering sources including appliances' electromagnetic emanations and noise injections into the power network do not affect the performance of TouchAuth. A key advantage of TouchAuth is that the iBEP sensing requires a simple analog-to-digital converter only, which is widely available on microcontrollers. Compared with existing approaches including intra-body communication and physiological sensing, TouchAuth is a low-cost, lightweight, and convenient approach for authorized users to access the smart objects found in indoor environments.},

abstract = {Sign language is a natural and fully-formed communication method for deaf or hearing-impaired people. Unfortunately, most of the state-of-the-art sign recognition technologies are limited by either high energy consumption or expensive device costs and have a difficult time providing a real-time service in a daily-life environment. Inspired by previous works on motion detection with wearable devices, we propose Sign Speaker - a real-time, robust, and user-friendly American sign language recognition (ASLR) system with affordable and portable commodity mobile devices. SignSpeaker is deployed on a smartwatch along with a smartphone; the smartwatch collects the sign signals and the smartphone outputs translation through an inbuilt loudspeaker. We implement a prototype system and run a series of experiments that demonstrate the promising performance of our system. For example, the average translation time is approximately $1.1$ seconds for a sentence with eleven words. The average detection ratio and reliability of sign recognition are 99.2% and 99.5%, respectively. The average word error rate of continuous sentence recognition is 1.04% on average.},

abstract = {Most existing Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) systems are able to understand the 3D geometry of the surroundings but lack the ability to detect and classify complex objects in the real world. Such capabilities can be enabled with deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), but it remains difficult to execute large networks on mobile devices. Offloading object detection to the edge or cloud is also very challenging due to the stringent requirements on high detection accuracy and low end-to-end latency. The long latency of existing offloading techniques can significantly reduce the detection accuracy due to changes in the user's view. To address the problem, we design a system that enables high accuracy object detection for commodity AR/MR system running at 60fps. The system employs low latency offloading techniques, decouples the rendering pipeline from the offloading pipeline, and uses a fast object tracking method to maintain detection accuracy. The result shows that the system can improve the detection accuracy by 20.2%-34.8% for the object detection and human keypoint detection tasks, and only requires 2.24ms latency for object tracking on the AR device. Thus, the system leaves more time and computational resources to render virtual elements for the next frame and enables higher quality AR/MR experiences.},

abstract = {Longer range, in rural/urban IoT networks, allow a large geographical coverage with only a few base-stations, making their deployment and operation economical. In this paper we explore the 150-174 MHz spectrum for long range IoT networks comprising unlicensed MURS and licensed VHF narrowbands. Range in these bands is boosted by the lower RF frequencies as well as higher transmit powers allowed by the FCC. Through a 400 sq km wide area deployment study, we show that, these spectrum bands can provide &gt; 20\texttimes{} the geographical coverage than that in the 900 MHz ISM band LoRa. Increased range translates to greater uplink IoT device traffic. The key contribution of this paper is a novel technique - Blind Distributed MU-MIMO, that allows capacity to scale with the number of antennas (base- stations) while not requiring any coordinated channel measurements between the devices and IoT base- stations. This requirement is crucial since in IoT networks power constrained IoT devices typically sleep and wake up to transmit short messages in response to unpredictable events without any coordination with the base-stations. We demonstrate the efficacy of Blind Distributed MU-MIMO through a real wide area deployment.},

abstract = {Quick response (QR) codes are becoming pervasive due to their rapid readability and the popularity of smartphones with built-in cameras. QR codes are also gaining importance in the retail sector as a convenient mobile payment method. However, researchers have concerns regarding the security of QR codes, which leave users susceptible to financial loss or private information leakage. In this study, we addressed this issue by developing a novel QR code (called mQRCode), which exploits patterns presenting a specific spatial frequency as a form of camouflage. When the targeted receiver holds a camera in a designated position (e.g., directly in front at a distance of 30 cm from the camouflaged QR code), the original QR code is revealed in form of a Moire pattern. From any other position, only the camouflaged QR code can be seen. In experiments, the decryption rate of mQRCode was &gt; 98.6% within 10.2 frames via a multi-frame decryption method. The decryption rate for cameras positioned 20° off axis or &gt; 10cm away from the designated location dropped to 0%, indicating that mQRCode is robust against attacks.},

abstract = {Recent studies show that the voice control system (VCS) is subject to the inaudible voice command attack, which can not be heard by human ears but can be recorded by the microphone. An adversary could leverage the attack to disable the VCS user's home security system, leak the victim's privacy or download malware stealthily. Efforts have been dedicated to developing forensics based defense mechanisms, which target at detecting traces of the attack signal; however, we find that existing approaches of the kind still leave loopholes. Moreover, a complete defense mechanism should be able to not only detect the attack but also cancel out the attack signal, and meanwhile ensure the legitimate voice commands unaffected, which however is still unavailable to the best of our knowledge. This paper is an attempt to fill the gap. We first systematically analyze existing forensics based defense mechanisms and reveal the root cause of their loopholes. Then we present an active inaudible-voice-command cancellation (AIC) design, which can reliably detect and capture the attack signal facilitated by our custom-designed "guard'' signal transmitter. AIC can create a special spectrum in the passband of the VCS microphone, based on which we are able to neutralize the attack signal in software means. We implement a prototype of our defense system and conduct comprehensive experiments to validate our design.},

abstract = {Despite the pervasive use of real-time video telephony services, the users' quality of experience (QoE) remains unsatisfactory, especially over the mobile Internet. Previous work studied the problem via controlled experiments, while a systematic and in-depth investigation in the wild is still missing. To bridge the gap, we conduct a large-scale measurement campaign on appname, an operational mobile video telephony service. Our measurement logs fine-grained performance metrics over 1 million video call sessions. Our analysis shows that the application-layer video codec and transport-layer protocols remain highly uncoordinated, which represents one major reason for the low QoE. We thus propose name, a machine learning based framework to resolve the issue. Instead of blindly following the transport layer's estimation of network capacity, name reviews historical logs of both layers, and extracts high-level features of codec/network dynamics, based on which it determines the highest bitrates for forthcoming video frames without incurring congestion. To attain the ability, we train name with the aforementioned massive data traces using a custom-designed imitation learning algorithm, which enables name to learn from past experience. We have implemented and incorporated name into appname. Our experiments show that name outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, improving video quality while reducing stalling time by multi-folds under various practical scenarios.},

abstract = {The virtualization of radio access networks (vRAN) is the last milestone in the NFV revolution. However, the complex dependencies between computing and radio resources make vRAN resource control particularly daunting. We present vrAIn, a dynamic resource controller for vRANs based on deep reinforcement learning. First, we use an autoencoder to project high-dimensional context data (traffic and signal quality patterns) into a latent representation. Then, we use a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm based on an actor-critic neural network structure and a classifier to map (encoded) contexts into resource control decisions. We have implemented vrAIn using an open-source LTE stack over different platforms. Our results show that vrAIn successfully derives appropriate compute and radio control actions irrespective of the platform and context: (i) it provides savings in computational capacity of up to 30% over CPU-unaware methods; (ii) it improves the probability of meeting QoS targets by 25% over static allocation policies using similar CPU resources in average; (iii) upon CPU capacity shortage, it improves throughput performance by 25% over state-of-the-art schemes; and (iv) it performs close to optimal policies resulting from an offline oracle. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that thoroughly studies the computational behavior of vRANs, and the first approach to a model-free solution that does not need to assume any particular vRAN platform or system conditions.},

In this paper, we describe the experience of the research and development team designing, implementing and evaluating Amulet? an open-hardware, open-software wrist-worn computing device? and its experience using Amulet to deploy mHealth apps in the field. In the past five years the team conducted 11 studies in the lab and in the field, involving 204 participants and collecting over 77,780 hours of sensor data. We describe the technical issues the team encountered and the lessons they learned, and conclude with a set of recommendations. We anticipate the experience described herein will be useful for the development of other research-oriented computing platforms. It should also be useful for researchers interested in developing and deploying mHealth applications, whether with the Amulet system or with other wearable platforms.},

However, from a clinical researcher point of view, testing novel use of the mobile health innovations remains a major hurdle, as composing a clinical trial using a combination of technologies still remains in the realm of computer scientists. We take a software-inspired viewpoint of clinical trial designs to design, develop and validate HealthSense to enable expressibility of complex ideas, composability with diverse devices and services while maximally maintaining simplicity for a clinical research user. A key innovation in HealthSense is the concept of a study state manager (SSM) that modifies parameters of the study over time as data accumulates and can trigger external events that affect the participant; this design allows us to implement nearly arbitrary clinical trial designs. The SSM can funnel data streams to custom or third-party cloud processing pipelines and the result can be used to give interventions and modify parameters of the study. HealthSense supports both Android and iOS platforms and is secure, scalable and fully operational. We outline three trials (two with clinical populations) to highlight simplicity, composability, and expressibility of HealthSense.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) are densely deployed in smart environments, such as homes, factories and laboratories, where many people have physical access to IoT devices. How to authenticate users operating on these devices is thus an important problem. IoT devices usually lack conventional user interfaces, such as keyboards and mice, which makes traditional authentication methods inapplicable. We present a virtual sensing technique that allows IoT devices to virtually sense user 'petting' (in the form of some very simple touches for about 2 seconds) on the devices. Based on this technique, we build a secure and intuitive authentication method that authenticates device users by comparing the petting operations sensed by devices and those captured by the user wristband. The authentication method is highly secure as physical operations are required, rather than based on proximity. It is also intuitive, adopting very simple authentication operations, e.g., clicking buttons, twisting rotary knobs, and swiping touchscreens. Unlike the state-of-the-art methods, our method does not require any hardware modifications of devices, and thus can be applied to commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices. We build prototypes and evaluate them comprehensively, demonstrating their high effectiveness, security, usability, and efficiency.},

abstract = {Future WLAN devices will combine both IEEE 802.11ad and 802.11ac interfaces. The former provides multi-Gbps rates but is susceptible to blockage, whereas the latter is slower but offers reliable connectivity. A fundamental challenge is thus how to combine those complementary technologies, to make the most of the advantages they offer. In this work, we explore leveraging Multipath TCP (MPTCP) to use both interfaces simultaneously in order to achieve a higher overall throughput as well as seamlessly switching to a single interface when the other one fails. We find that standard MPTCP often performs sub-optimally and may even yield a throughput much lower than that of single path TCP over the faster of the two interfaces. We analyze the cause of these performance issues in detail and then design MuSher, an agile MPTCP scheduler that allows MPTCP to fully utilize the channel resources available to both interfaces. Our evaluation in realistic scenarios shows that MuSher provides a throughput improvement of up to 1.5x/2.3x and speeds up the recovery of a traffic stream, after disruption, by a factor of up to 8x/75x, under WLAN/Internet settings respectively, compared to the default MPTCP scheduler.},

To achieve this long range, we use the transmitter as an RF power source that can be on or off if it does or does not send a packet, respectively, and a receiver that repeatedly measures the noise and interference power level. We use spread spectrum techniques on top of the basic on/off mechanism to overcome the interference caused by other devices' channel access to provide long ranges at a much lower data rate. We implement the protocol on top of commodity WiFi hardware. We discuss our design and how we overcome key challenges such as non-stationary interference, carrier sensing and hardware timing delays. We test ONPC in several situations to show that it achieves significantly longer range than standard WiFi.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose XModal-ID, a novel WiFi-video cross-modal gait-based person identification system. Given the WiFi signal measured when an unknown person walks in an unknown area and a video footage of a walking person in another area, XModal-ID can determine whether it is the same person in both cases or not. XModal-ID only uses the Channel State Information (CSI) magnitude measurements of a pair of off-the-shelf WiFi transceivers. It does not need any prior wireless or video measurement of the person to be identified. Similarly, it does not need any knowledge of the operation area or person's track. Finally, it can identify people through walls. XModal-ID utilizes the video footage to simulate the WiFi signal that would be generated if the person in the video walked near a pair of WiFi transceivers. It then uses a new processing approach to robustly extract key gait features from both the real WiFi signal and the video-based simulated one, and compares them to determine if the person in the WiFi area is the same person in the video. We extensively evaluate XModal-ID by building a large test set with $8$ subjects, $2$ video areas, and $5$ WiFi areas, including 3 through-wall areas as well as complex walking paths, all of which are not seen during the training phase. Overall, we have a total of 2,256 WiFi-video test pairs. XModal-ID then achieves an $85%$ accuracy in predicting whether a pair of WiFi and video samples belong to the same person or not. Furthermore, in a ranking scenario where XModal-ID compares a WiFi sample to $8$ candidate video samples, it obtains top-1, top-2, and top-3 accuracies of $75%$, $90%$, and $97%$. These results show that XModal-ID can robustly identify new people walking in new environments, in various practical scenarios.},

abstract = {Channel information plays an important role in modern wireless communication systems. Systems that use different frequency bands for uplink and downlink communication often need feedback between devices to exchange band specific channel information. The current state-of-the-art approach proposes a way to predict the channel in the downlink based on that of the observed uplink by identifying variables underlying the uplink channel. In this paper we present a solution that greatly reduces the complexity of this task, and is even applicable for single antenna devices. Our approach uses a neural network trained on a standard channel model to generate coarse estimates for the variables underlying the channel. We then use a simple and efficient single antenna optimization framework to get more accurate variable estimates, which can be used for downlink channel prediction. We implement our approach on software defined radios and compare it to the state-of-the-art through experiments and simulations. Results show that our approach reduces the time complexity by at least an order of magnitude (10x), while maintaining similar prediction quality.},

abstract = {Smart speakers allow users to interact with home appliances using voice commands and are becoming increasingly popular. While voice-based interface is intuitive, it is insufficient in many scenarios, such as in noisy or quiet environments, for users with language barriers, or in applications that require continuous motion tracking. Motion-based control is attractive and complementary to existing voice-based control. However, accurate and reliable room-scale motion tracking poses a significant challenge due to low SNR, interference, and varying mobility. To this end, we develop a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) based system that uses speakers and microphones to realize accurate room-scale tracking. Our system jointly estimates the propagation distance and angle-of-arrival (AoA) of signals reflected by the hand, based on AoA-distance profiles generated by 2D MUSIC. We design a series of techniques to significantly enhance the profile quality under low SNR. We feed the profiles in a recent history to our RNN to estimate the distance and AoA. In this way, we can exploit the temporal structure among consecutive profiles to remove the impact of noise, interference and mobility. Using extensive evaluation, we show our system achieves 1.2--3.7~cm error within 4.5~m range, supports tracking multiple users, and is robust against ambient sound. To our knowledge, this is the first acoustic device-free room-scale tracking system.},

abstract = {A farm's soil moisture and soil electrical conductivity (EC)readings are extremely valuable for a farmer. They can help her reduce water use and improve productivity. However, the high cost of commercial soil moisture sensors and the inaccuracy of sub-1000 dollar EC sensors have limited their adoption. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a system, called Strobe, that senses soil moisture and soil EC using RF propagation in existing Wi-Fi bands. Strobe overcomes the key challenge of limited bandwidth availability in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed spectrum using a novel multi-antenna technique. It maps the propagation time and amplitude of Wi-Fi signals received by different antennas to the soil permittivity and EC, which in turn depend on soil moisture and salinity. Our experiments with USRP, WARP, and commodity Wi-Fi cards show that Strobe can accurately estimate soil moisture and EC using Wi-Fi, thereby showing the potential of a future in which a farmer can sense soil in their farm without investing 1000s of dollars in soil sensing equipments.},

abstract = {Despite widespread popularity, today's microwave ovens are limited in their cooking capabilities, given that they heat food blindly, resulting in a non-uniform and unpredictable heating distribution. We present SDC (software-defined cooking), a low-cost closed-loop microwave oven system that aims to heat the food in a software-defined thermal trajectory. SDC achieves this through a novel high-resolution heat sensing and actuation system that uses microwave-safe components to augment existing microwaves. SDC first senses thermal gradient by using arrays of neon lamps that are charged by the Electromagnetic (EM) field a microwave produces. SDC then modifies the EM-field strength to desired levels by accurately moving food on a programmable turntable towards sensed hot and cold spots. To create a more skewed arbitrary thermal pattern, SDC further introduces two types of programmable accessories: microwave shield and susceptor. We design and implement one experimental test-bed by modifying a commercial off-the-shelf microwave oven. Our evaluation shows that SDC can programmatically create temperature deltas at a resolution of 21 degrees with a spatial resolution of 3 cm without accessories and 183 degrees with the help of accessories. We further demonstrate how a SDC-enabled microwave can be enlisted to perform unexpected cooking tasks: cooking meat and fat in bacon discriminatively and heating milk uniformly.},

abstract = {Wireless sensing has demonstrated the potential of using Wi-Fi signals to track people and objects, even behind walls.Yet, prior work in this space aims to merely detect the presence of objects around corners, rather than their type. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of the following re-search question: ?Can commodity Wi-Fi radios detect both the location and type of moving objects around them?". We present IntuWition, a complementary sensing system that can sense the location and type of material of objects in the environment, including those out of line-of-sight. It achieves this by sensing wireless signals reflected off surrounding objects using commodity Wi-Fi radios, whose signals penetrate walls and occlusions. At the core of IntuWition is the idea that different materials reflect and scatter polarized waves in different ways. We build upon ideas from RADAR Polarimetry to detect the material of objects across spatial locations, despite mobility of the sensing device and the hardware non-idealities of commodity Wi-Fi radios. A detailed feasibility study reveals an average accuracy of 95% in line-of-sight and 92% in non-line-of-sight in classifying five types of materials:copper, aluminum, plywood, birch, and human. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept application of our system on an autonomous UAV that uses its onboard Wi-Fi radios to sense whether an occlusion is a person versus another UAV.},

abstract = {The growing trend of multi-device ownerships creates a need and an opportunity to use applications across multiple devices. However, in general, the current app development and usage still remain within the single-device paradigm, falling far short of user expectations. For example, it is currently not possible for a user to dynamically partition an existing live streaming app with chatting capabilities across different devices, such that she watches her favorite broadcast on her smart TV while real-time chatting on her smartphone. In this paper, we present FLUID, a new Android-based multi-device platform that enables innovative ways of using multiple devices. FLUID aims to i) allow users to migrate or replicate individual user interfaces (UIs) of a single app on multiple devices (high flexibility), ii) require no additional development effort to support unmodified, legacy applications (ease of development), and iii) support a wide range of apps that follow the trend of using custom-made UIs (wide applicability). Previous approaches, such as screen mirroring, app migration, and customized apps utilizing multiple devices, do not satisfy those goals altogether. FLUID, on the other hand, meets the goals by carefully analyzing which UI states are necessary to correctly render UI objects, deploying only those states on different devices, supporting cross-device function calls transparently, and synchronizing the UI states of replicated UI objects across multiple devices. Our evaluation with 20 unmodified, real-world Android apps shows that FLUID can transparently support a wide range of apps and is fast enough for interactive use.},

abstract = {Low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs) are a compelling answer to the networking challenges faced by many Internet of Things devices. Their combination of low power, long range, and deployment ease has motivated a flurry of research, including exciting results on backscatter and interference cancellation that further lower power budgets and increase capacity. But despite the interest, we argue that unlicensed LPWAN technologies can only serve a narrow class of Internet of Things applications due to two principal challenges: capacity and coexistence. We propose a metric, bit flux, to describe networks and applications in terms of throughput over a coverage area. Using bit flux, we find that the combination of low bit rate and long range restricts the use case of LPWANs to sparse sensing applications. Furthermore, this lack of capacity leads networks to use as much available bandwidth as possible, and a lack of coexistence mechanisms causes poor performance in the presence of multiple, independently-administered networks. We discuss a variety of techniques and approaches that could be used to address these two challenges and enable LPWANs to achieve the promise of ubiquitous connectivity.},

abstract = {With recent advances in in-band full duplex techniques, full duplex capable relays have been shown feasible in many recent works. Instead of generating data itself to transmit, a full duplex relay can forward the received signal while receiving it. It also has the opportunity to properly modify the signal before forwarding it, which has been explored to enable constructive and destructive full duplex relaying recently. With these designs, the signal through the full duplex relay could constructively or destructively add up with the signal from the direct link at the receiver side. As a result, the received signal power may be boosted or greatly reduced, compared with direct forwarding. In this paper, we do detailed analysis on whether such constructive and destructive full duplex relays are possible. We find that for OFDM signals, such relays can not be achieved if the additional latency of the relayed path is more than one sample time than the direct link. Our analysis and results challenge the assumptions on the relay latency requirements of previous works to realize such systems.},

We also provide performance results and lessons learned from a real-world CoLTE network deployed in rural Indonesia.

abstract = {Deep-learning (DL) is receiving huge attention as enabling techniques for emerging mobile and IoT applications. It is a common practice to conduct DNN model-based inference using cloud services due to their high computation and memory cost. However, such a cloud-offloaded inference raises serious privacy concerns. Malicious external attackers or untrustworthy internal administrators of clouds may leak highly sensitive and private data such as image, voice and textual data. In this paper, we propose Occlumency, a novel cloud-driven solution designed to protect user privacy without compromising the benefit of using powerful cloud resources. Occlumency leverages secure SGX enclave to preserve the confidentiality and the integrity of user data throughout the entire DL inference process. DL inference in SGX enclave, however, impose a severe performance degradation due to limited physical memory space and inefficient page swapping. We designed a suite of novel techniques to accelerate DL inference inside the enclave with a limited memory size and implemented Occlumency based on Caffe. Our experiment with various DNN models shows that Occlumency improves inference speed by 3.6x compared to the baseline DL inference in SGX and achieves a secure DL inference within 72% of latency overhead compared to inference in the native environment.},

abstract = {IoT and deep learning based computer vision together create an immense market opportunity, but running deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained IoT devices remains challenging. Offloading DNN inference to an edge server is a promising solution, but limited wireless bandwidth bottlenecks its end-to-end performance and scalability. While IoT devices can adopt source compression to cope with the limited bandwidth, existing compression algorithms (or codecs) are not designed for DNN (but for human eyes), and thus, suffer from either low compression rates or high DNN inference errors. This paper presents GRACE, a DNN-aware compression algorithm that facilitates the edge inference by significantly saving the network bandwidth consumption without disturbing the inference performance. Given a target DNN, GRACE (i) analyzes DNN's perception model w.r.t both spatial frequencies and colors and (ii) generates an optimized compression strategy for the model -- one-time offline process. Next, GRACE deploys thus-generated compression strategy at IoT devices (or source) to perform online source compression within the existing codec framework, adding no extra overhead. We prototype GRACE on JPEG (the most popular image codec framework), and our evaluation results show that GRACE indeed achieves the superior compression performance over existing strategies for key DNN applications. For semantic segmentation tasks, GRACE reduces a source size by 23% compared to JPEG with similar interference accuracy (0.38% lower than GRACE). Further, GRACE even achieves 7.5% higher inference accuracy than JPEG with a commonly used quality level of 75 does. For classification tasks, GRACE reduces the bandwidth consumption by 90% over JPEG with the same inference accuracy.},

abstract = {Web browsing, previously optimized for the desktop environment, is being fine-tuned for energy-efficient use on mobile devices. Although active attempts have been made to reduce energy consumption, the advent of energy-aware scheduling (EAS) integrated in the recent devices suggests the possibility of a new approach for optimizing energy use by browsers. Our preliminary analysis showed that the existing EAS-enabled system is overly optimized for performance, leading to energy inefficiencies while a web browser is running. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of web browsers, and investigate the cause of energy inefficiency in EAS-enabled mobile devices. We then propose a system, called WebTune, to improve the energy efficiency of mobile browsers. Exploiting the reinforcement learning technique, WebTune learns the optimal execution speed of the web browser's processes, and adjusts the speed at runtime, thus saving energy and ensuring the quality of service (QoS). WebTune is implemented on the latest Android-based smartphones, and evaluated with Alexa's top 200 websites. The experimental results show that WebTune reduced the device-level energy consumption of the Google Pixel 2 XL and Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus smartphones by 18.7-22.0% and 13.7-16.1%, respectively, without degrading the QoS.},

Analysis of the resulting dataset poses unique challenges; methods in the status quo are tailored for specific spectrum-related applications (apps), and are ill equipped to process data of this magnitude. In this paper, we design BigSpec, a general-purpose framework that allows for fast processing of apps. The key idea is to reduce computation costs by performing computation extensively on compressed data that preserves signal features. Adhering to this guideline, we build solutions for three apps, i.e., energy detection, spatio-temporal spectrum estimation, and anomaly detection. These apps were chosen to highlight BigSpec's efficiency, scalability, and extensibility. To evaluate BigSpec's performance, we collect more than 1 terabyte of spectrum data spanning a year, across 300MHz-4GHz, covering 400 km2. Compared with baselines and prior works, we achieve 17\texttimes{} run time efficiency, sublinear rather than linear run time scalability, and extend the definition of anomaly to different domains (frequency &amp; spatio-temporal). We also obtain high-level insights from the data to provide valuable advice on future spectrum measurement and data analysis.},

abstract = {Due to extremely low power consumption, backscatter has become the transmission mechanism of choice for battery-free devices that operate on harvested energy. However, a limitation of recent backscatter systems is that the communication range scales with the strength of the ambient carrier signal~(ACS). This means that to achieve a long-range, a backscatter tag needs to reflect a strong ACS, which in practice means that it needs to be close to an ACS emitter. We present TunnelScatter, a mechanism that overcomes this limitation. TunnelScatter uses a tunnel diode-based radio frequency oscillator to enable transmissions when there is no ACS, and the same oscillator as a reflection amplifier to support backscatter transmissions when the ACS is weak. Our results show that even without an ACS, TunnelScatter is able to transmit through several walls covering a distance of 18m while consuming a peak biasing power of SI57 microwatt. Based on TunnelScatter, we design battery-free sensor tags, called TunnelTags, that can sense physical phenomena and transmit them using the TunnelScatter mechanism.},

abstract = {Device Administrator (DA) capabilities for mobile devices, e.g., remote locking/wiping, or enforcing password strength, were originally introduced to help organizations manage phone fleets or enable parental control. However, DA capabilities have been subverted and abused: malicious apps have used DA to create ransomware or lock users out, while benign apps have used DA to prevent or hinder uninstallation; in certain cases the only remedy is to factory-reset the phone. We call these apps "Deathless Device Administrator" (DDA), i.e., apps that cannot be uninstalled. We provide the first systematic study of Android DA capabilities, DDA apps, DDA-attack resistance across Android versions, and DDA-induced families in malicious apps. To enable scalable studies of questionable DA behavior, we developed DAAX, a static analyzer which exposes potential DA abuse effectively and efficiently. In a corpus of 39,459 apps (20,467 malicious and 18,992 benign) DAAX has found 4,135 DA apps and 691 potential DDA apps. The static analysis results on the 4,135 apps were cross-checked via dynamic analysis on at least 3 phones, confirming 578 true DDAs, including apps currently on Google Play. The study has shown that DAAX is effective (84.8% F-measure) and efficient (analysis typically takes 205 seconds per app).},

abstract = {White noise machines are among the most popular devices to facilitate infant sleep. We introduce the first contactless system that uses white noise to achieve motion and respiratory monitoring in infants. Our system is designed for smart speakers that can monitor an infant's sleep using white noise. The key enabler underlying our system is a set of novel algorithms that can extract the minute infant breathing motion as well as position information from white noise which is random in both the time and frequency domain. We describe the design and implementation of our system, and present experiments with a life-like infant simulator as well as a clinical study at the neonatal intensive care unit with five new-born infants. Our study demonstrates that the respiratory rate computed by our system is highly correlated with the ground truth with a correlation coefficient of 0.938.},

abstract = {Frequent blood pressure (BP) assessment is key to the diagnosis and treatment of many severe diseases, such as heart failure, kidney failure, hypertension, and hemodialysis. Current "gold-standard'' BP measurement techniques require the complete blockage of blood flow, which causes discomfort and disruption to normal activity when the assessment is done repetitively and frequently. Unfortunately, patients with hypertension or hemodialysis often have to get their BP measured every 15 minutes for a duration of 4-5 hours or more. The discomfort of wearing a cumbersome and limited mobility device affects their normal activities. In this work, we propose a device called eBP to measure BP from inside the user's ear aiming to minimize the measurement's impact on users' normal activities while maximizing its comfort level. eBP has 3 key components: (1) a light-based pulse sensor attached on an inflatable pipe that goes inside the ear, (2) a digital air pump with a fine controller, and (3) a BP estimation algorithm. In contrast to existing devices, eBP introduces a novel technique that eliminates the need to block the blood flow inside the ear, which alleviates the user's discomfort. We prototyped eBP custom hardware and software and evaluated the system through a comparative study on 35 subjects. The study shows that eBP obtains the average error of 1.8 mmHg and -3.1 mmHg and a standard deviation error of 7.2 mmHg and 7.9 mmHg for systolic (high-pressure value) and diastolic (low-pressure value), respectively. These errors are around the acceptable margins regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows mean errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg.},

abstract = {In recent years, convolutional networks have demonstrated unprecedented performance in the image restoration task of super-resolution (SR). SR entails the upscaling of a single low-resolution image in order to meet application-specific image quality demands and plays a key role in mobile devices. To comply with privacy regulations and reduce the overhead of cloud computing, executing SR models locally on-device constitutes a key alternative approach. Nevertheless, the excessive compute and memory requirements of SR workloads pose a challenge in mapping SR networks on resource-constrained mobile platforms. This work presents MobiSR, a novel framework for performing efficient super-resolution on-device. Given a target mobile platform, the proposed framework considers popular model compression techniques and traverses the design space to reach the highest performing trade-off between image quality and processing speed. At run time, a novel scheduler dispatches incoming image patches to the appropriate model-engine pair based on the patch's estimated upscaling difficulty in order to meet the required image quality with minimum processing latency. Quantitative evaluation shows that the proposed framework yields on-device SR designs that achieve an average speedup of 2.13x over highly-optimized parallel difficulty-unaware mappings and 4.79x over highly-optimized single compute engine implementations.},

abstract = {3D maps of urban environments are useful in various fields ranging from cellular network planning to urban planning and climatology. These models are typically constructed using expensive techniques such as manual annotation with 3D modeling tools, extrapolated from satellite or aerial photography, or using specialized hardware with depth sensing devices. In this work, we show that 3D urban maps can be extracted from standard GNSS data, by analyzing the received satellite signals that are attenuated by obstacles, such as buildings. Furthermore, we show that these models can be extracted from low-accuracy GNSS data, crowdsourced opportunistically from standard smartphones during their user's uncontrolled daily commute trips, unleashing the potential of applying the principle to wide areas. Our proposal incorporates position inaccuracies in the calculations, and accommodates different sources of variability of the satellite signals' SNR. The diversity of collection conditions of crowdsourced GNSS positions is used to mitigate bias and noise from the data. A binary classification model is trained and evaluated on multiple urban scenarios using data crowdsourced from over 900 users. Our results show that the generalization accuracy for a Random Forest classifier in typical urban environments lies between 79% and 91% on 4 m wide voxels, demonstrating the potential of the proposed method for building 3D maps for wide urban areas.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has had a tremendous impact in across the world over the last decade. As we think about ML solving complex tasks, sometimes at super-human levels, it is easy to forget that there is no machine learning without humans in the loop. Humans define tasks and metrics, develop and program algorithms, collect and label data, debug and optimize systems, and are (usually) ultimately the users of the ML-based applications we are developing. In this talk, we will cover 4 human-centered perspectives in the ML development process, along with methods and systems, to empower humans to maximize the ultimate impact of their ML-based applications. In particular, we will cover: 1. Developer tools for ML that allow a wider range of people to create intelligent applications?, focusing on mobile devices. 2. Learning to optimize the performance and power of ML models on a wide range of hardware backends and mobile devices. 3. Closing the gap between the loss function we optimize in ML and the product metrics we really want to optimize. 4. Helping humans understand why ML models make each prediction, when these models will break, and how to improve them.},

abstract = {This work enhances the machine-to-human communication between electronic toll collection (ETC) systems and drivers by providing an AM broadcast service to deployed ETC systems. This demo is the first to show that ultra-high radio frequency identification signals can be received by an AM radio receiver due to the presence of the nonlinearity effect in the AM receiver. Such a phenomenon allows the development of a previously infeasible cross-technology communication, called Tagcaster, which converts an ETC reader to an AM station for broadcasting short messages (e.g, charged-fees and traffic forecast) to drivers at tollbooths. The prototype of Tagcaster is designed, implemented and evaluated over four general and five vehicle-mounted AM receivers (e.g, Toyota, Audi, and Jetta). Experiments reveal that Tagcaster can provide good-quality (PESQ&gt;2) and stable AM broadcasting service with a 30m coverage range.},

On the bicycle side, a microcontroller, a rotation sensor, and a Bluetooth module are used to calculate the cycling speed of the biker, sense the rotation period of wheels, and communicate with the biker's smartphone, respectively. On the biker side, a smartphone is used to detect the riding direction (through the built-in gyroscope), receive the cycling speed data (through Bluetooth communications), and determine the feasible frame updating rate of street view/virtual reality (through the proposed fuzzy control mechanism). Based on the current and historical cycling speeds, All-You-Can-Bike can derive the feasible frame updating rate based on the defined fuzzy sets of wheel rotation periods and cycling acceleration. An Android-based prototype with the Arduino developing board is implemented to verify the feasibility and superiority of our All-You-Can-Bike system.},

Further more, it can recover the high frequency signal from the relatively low sampling rate data. In our demonstration, we put one tag on the surface of ukulele (not the string) and achieve the overall recognition accuracy of $93%, 90%, 87%, 81%$ when using 1,2,3,4 strings, respectively. Compared to typical machine learning based RF sensing systems, our system is model driven instead of data driven, which requires little training effort and could be applicable across different locations.

However, the network emulation with the TUN/TAP device cannot emulate the operation of the WLAN protocols such as ETSI DCC, which dynamically changes transmission power and interval based on receive signal strength indication (RSSI), because the TUN/TAP device cannot capture IEEE 802.11 frames and control parameters such as transmission power, RSSI.

abstract = {We will introduce and demonstrate CoLTE, an all-in-one solution for LTE-based community networks. CoLTE is a lightweight, Internet-only LTE core network (EPC) based on OpenAirInterface. CoLTE is designed to facilitate the deployment and operation of small-scale, community owned and operated LTE networks, with a particular eye towards expanding Internet access into rural areas with limited and unreliable backhaul. CoLTE comes paired with a basic, IP-based network manager called Haulage, as well as basic locally-hosted webservices. The key differentiator of CoLTE, when compared to existing LTE solutions, is that in CoLTE the EPC is designed to be located in the field and deployed alongside a small number of cellular radios (eNodeBs), as opposed to the centralized model seen in large-scale telecom networks.},

abstract = {We present a demonstration of Jive (Joint Integration of VLC and Encryption), a novel encryption key sharing framework utilizing the emerging wireless technology Visible Light Communication (VLC). Based on the idea of transmitting data by modulating light, we are able to (1) share a secret key within a constrained physical space and (2) leverage this shared key to communicate encrypted information among co-located mobile devices. In this demonstration, we showcase our complete implementation of Jive: a VLC transmitter and a VLC receiver. Both endpoints are built using off-the-shelf components. The VLC link is used to distribute a randomly generated secret key that can only be "observed" by VLC receivers that are physically in the same space as the transmitter. Each receiver is connected over a serial connection to an Android device; we developed applications for Android that take the key from the VLC receiver and subsequently use the key to encrypt or decrypt application data. Our demo invites participants to create their own encrypted messages in the Android application and interact with the VLC prototype as it transmits encryption keys, thus illustrating our system's ability to bootstrap security among physically co-located devices.},

With the observation of nonlinear and time-varying characteristics of LCD, we present sys, a novel modulation scheme named Delayed Superimposition Modulation (DSM) to achieve 4kbps, which is 4x rate over the status-quo.

To tackle this issue, we present DAOW, a commercial game-oriented Android emulator implementing the idea of direct Android emulation, which eliminates the overhead of full virtualization by providing foreign Android binaries with direct access to the domestic PC hardware through Windows kernel interfaces. In this demo, we will demonstrate that DAOW essentially outperforms traditional AOVB-based emulators in terms of running smoothness, game startup time, and memory usage.},

Notably, we design a robust MA removal method to mitigate the impact of MA. Furthermore, we explore the uniqueness of the human cardiac system and extract the fiducial features in the PPG measurements to train the gradient boosting tree (GBT) classifier, which can effectively differentiate users continuously using low training effort. In particular, we build the prototype of our system using a commodity smartwatch and a WebSocket server running on a laptop for CA. In order to demonstrate the practical use of our system, we will demo our prototype under different scenarios (i.e., static and moving) to show it can effectively detect MA caused by daily activities and achieve a high authentication success rate.},

Using projections, we further show that up to 12.8 Gbps could be supported with just 50% CPU utilization.

In in-band-based software-defined wireless networks (IB-SDWNs), the control plane shares wireless channels with the data plane. As the amount of data-plane traffic increases, the interference from the data plane to the control plane becomes stronger, and the switches connected to the SDN controller via the control plane may become out-of-control. In this paper, we propose an interference management scheme that reduces the interference among control and data planes by adjusting the transmission rates of data-plane traffic in switches to ensure reliable connections between the SDN controller and switches. We implemented a prototype of an IB-SDWN and showed that the proposed interference management scheme ensures the reliability of control planes.},

Regarding the design of acoustic communication, throughput and inaudibility are the most vital aspects, which greatly affect available applications that can be supported and their user experience. Existing studies on acoustic communication either use audible frequency band (e.g., &lt;20kHz) to achieve a relatively high throughput or realize inaudibility using near-ultrasonic frequency band (e.g., 18-20kHz) which however can only achieve limited throughput. Leveraging the non-linearity of microphones, voice commands can be demodulated from the ultrasound signals, and further recognized by the speech recognition systems. In this poster, we design an acoustic communication system, which achieves high-throughput and inaudibility at the same time, and the highest throughput we achieve is over 17x higher than the state-of-the-art acoustic communication systems.},

However, the high cost of commercial soil moisture sensors and the inaccuracy of sub-1000 dollar EC sensors have limited their adoption. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a system, called Strobe, that senses soil moisture and soil EC using RF propagation in existing Wi-Fi bands. Strobe overcomes the key challenge of limited bandwidth availability in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed spectrum using a novel multi-antenna technique. It maps the propagation time and amplitude of Wi-Fi signals received by different antennas to the soil permittivity and EC, which in turn depend on soil moisture and salinity. Our experiments with USRP, WARP, and commodity Wi-Fi cards show that Strobe can accurately estimate soil moisture and EC using Wi-Fi, thereby showing the potential of a future where a farmer can sense soil in their farm without investing 1000s of dollars in sensing tools.},

This is primarily due to the tight latency requirements and high bandwidth demanded by operations at the wireless PHY, as opposed to the network-layer. This poster argues that in the era of low-power Internet of Things, virtualization of physical layer functions deserves a revisit. We specifically study low-power Internet of Things technologies that present a ripe opportunity for cloudification of wireless network functions, with their lower bandwidths and lax latency constraints. We present our vision of how physical layer function virtualization should be structured to maximize benefits and performance. We present a feasibility study on the latency and scalability limits of such virtualization for various physical layer functions that could leverage such an architecture.},

In this work, we make the case for a ceilingmounted mobile (CMM) AP by comparing its performance with other types of AP mobility and single static AP. We then present Hawkeye to solve the optimal location discovery problem for a CMM AP using a machine learning (ML) algorithm. Hawkeye relies purely on the connectivity matrix between STAs and the AP to decide if and where the AP should move to for maximizing LOS connectivity. Using a prototype implementation, we show that the throughput of Hawkeye is 219% and 129% compared with single static AP and other approaches for AP mobility, respectively.},

Then machine learning can be used to analyze this data for precision agriculture. However, most of the IoT devices are resource-constrained devices, which results in poor performance while conducting a machine learning task. Thus, in SeamFarm, we consider distributing the data as well as the task to all available nodes. The results show that SeamFarm can meet all of the functional and non-functional requirements of distributed data analytic for precision agriculture.

abstract = {In recent years, convolutional networks have demonstrated unprecedented performance in the image restoration task of super-resolution (SR). SR entails the upscaling of a single low-resolution image in order to meet application-specific image quality demands and plays a key role in mobile devices. To comply with privacy regulations and reduce the overhead of cloud computing, executing SR models locally on-device constitutes a key alternative approach. Nevertheless, the excessive compute and memory requirements of SR workloads pose a challenge in mapping SR networks on resource-constrained mobile platforms. This work presents MobiSR, a novel framework for performing efficient super-resolution on-device. Given a target mobile platform, the proposed framework considers popular model compression techniques and traverses the design space to reach the highest performing trade-off between image quality and processing speed. At run time, a novel scheduler dispatches incoming image patches to the appropriate model-engine pair based on the patch's estimated upscaling difficulty in order to meet the required image quality with minimum processing latency. Quantitative evaluation shows that the proposed framework yields on-device SR designs that achieve an average speedup of 2.13x over highly-optimized parallel difficulty-unaware mappings and 4.79x over highly-optimized single compute engine implementations.},

To combat this issue, the promising idea of mobile micro-clouds (MMCs) is proposed to enhance edges and the cloud. In this paper, we investigate the problem of virtual cluster (VC) placement in MMCs, to minimize the average response latency with various requests among multiple cloud applications. Then a hybrid swarm intelligence approach is proposed to optimize VC placement scheme, for a trade-off between the average response latency and the overall VC placement cost.

However, such convenience also makes personal video clips easily obtained and exploited by malicious users who launch scam attacks. Existing studies only deal with the attacks that use fabricated facial masks, while the liveness detection that targets the playback attacks using a virtual camera is still elusive. In this work, we develop a novel video chat liveness detection system, which can track the weak light changes reflected off the skin of a human face leveraging chromatic eigenspace differences. We design an inconspicuous challenge frame with minimal intervention to the video chat and develop a robust anomaly frame detector to verify the liveness of remote user in a video chat session. Furthermore, we propose a resilient defense strategy to defeat both naive and intelligent playback attacks leveraging spatial and temporal verification. The evaluation results show that our system can achieve accurate and robust liveness detection with the accuracy and false detection rate as high as 97.7% (94.8%) and 1% (1.6%) on smartphones (laptops), respectively.},

abstract = {Quick response (QR) codes are becoming pervasive due to their rapid readability and the popularity of smartphones with built-in cameras. QR codes are also gaining importance in the retail sector as a convenient mobile payment method. However, researchers have concerns regarding the security of QR codes, which leave users susceptible to financial loss or private information leakage. In this study, we address this issue by developing a novel QR code (called mQR code), which exploits patterns presenting a specific spatial frequency as a form of camouflage. When the targeted receiver holds a camera in a designated position (e.g., directly in front at a distance of 30 cm from the camouflaged QR code), the original QR code is revealed in form of a Moir\'{e} pattern. From any other position, only the camouflaged QR code can be seen. In experiments, the decryption rate of mQR codes is $&gt; 98%$. The decryption rate for cameras positioned $20degree$ off axis or $&gt; 10cm$ from the designated location drops to $0%$, indicating that any attackers will be unable to steal a usable image.},

abstract = {Over the past few decades, Vehicular Ad hoc Networks have attracted the attention of numerous researchers from both academia and industry. Today, this promising wireless communication technology plays an indispensable role as vehicles exchange low-latent safety critical messages with one another in a bid to make the road traffic more safer, efficient, and convenient. However, dissemination of malicious messages within the network not only significantly reduces the network performance but also becomes a source of threat for the passengers and vulnerable pedestrians. Accordingly, a number of trust models have been recently proposed in the literature to ensure the identification and elimination of malicious vehicles from the network. These trust models primarily rely on the aggregation of both direct and indirect observations and evict the malicious vehicles based on a particular threshold set on this composite trust value. Nevertheless, setting-up of this threshold poses a significant challenge especially owing to diverse influential factors in such a dynamic and distributed networking environment. To this end, in this manuscript, machine learning has been employed to compute the aggregate trust score for flagging and evicting of the malicious vehicles from a vehicular network. It is evident from the simulated results that the devised method is both accurate and scalable.},

Firstly, we formulate this problem as a weighted graph matching problem consisting of graph matching and SFC mapping. Then, we propose a linear programming-based approach to match the edge network and SFC. Finally, we design a Hungarian-based placement algorithm to map SFC in the edge network. A heuristic-based greedy algorithm is also designed to compare the performance. Evaluation results show that our proposed solutions outperform the greedy algorithm in terms of execution time.},

To tap-in the gold-mine of data generated by IoT devices with unprecedented volume and value, we discover and leverage the hidden connections among the multimodal data collected by various sensing devices. Different modal data can complete and learn from each other, but it is challenging to fuse multimodal data without knowing their perception (and thus the correct labels). In this work, we propose MultiSense, a paradigm for automatically mining potential perception, cross-labelling each modal data, and then improving the learning models over the set of multimodal data. We design innovative solutions for segmenting, aligning, and fusing multimodal data from different sensors. We implement our framework and conduct comprehensive evaluations on a rich set of data. Our results demonstrate that MultiSense significantly improves the data usability and the power of the learning models.},

abstract = {Despite the pervasive use of real-time video telephony services, their quality of experience (QoE) remains unsatisfactory, especially over the mobile Internet. We conduct a large-scale measurement campaign on appname, an operational mobile video telephony service. Our analysis shows that the application-layer video codec and transport-layer protocols remain highly uncoordinated, which represents one major reason for the low QoE. We thus propose name, a machine learning based framework to resolve the issue. We train name with the massive data traces from the measurement campaign using a custom-designed imitation learning algorithm, which enables name to learn from past experience following an expert's iterative demonstration/supervision. We have implemented and incorporated name into the appname. Our experiments show that name outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, improving video quality while reducing stalling time by multi-folds under various practical scenarios.},

abstract = {Although communication networks have been constantly evolving and increasing their capacity with state-of-the-art solutions, it is still hard to provide reliable and high capacity communications in some cases referred to as challenged networks. In these networks, ensuring performance guarantees is hard either due to the lack of infrastructure or its limitations, such as in public safety networks, or due to the challenging communication medium, such as in mmWave networks. Challenged networks face now new constraints with the proliferation of services and applications, increasing number of connected devices, the high computing and control demands, unpredicted human behavior, and only partially-available information. CHANTS'19 aims at bringing researchers together to have a platform for discussing the challenges emerging with new use cases and real-life applications, such as edge computing or autonomous driving, and corresponding innovative approaches in tackling the limitations of the challenged networks. Moreover, this workshop aims at providing another perspective to the broader audience by listing a subset of problems that communication networks, despite the advances on many fronts, still have to tackle. The expected outcomes of CHANTS'19 have the potential to influence industrial thinking about the technologies of next-generation challenged networks.},

By fostering an explicit and deep integration of the end-user directly into the design, analysis and management of large-scale operational networks, we expect to reduce the gap between QoE research and its application to future network management paradigms, as well as to provide a more targeted end-user perspective to the research on distributed communication systems. The 4th edition of Internet-QoE also focuses on novel end-user services enabled by next generation technologies such as immersive media (3D, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality), self-driving cars, intelligent manufacturing systems, Industry 4.0 and tactile Internet, 5G ultra-low-latency mobile networks, and real-time applications.},

These surfaces act as an additional spatial path that enables MIMO capabilities without increasing the physical size of the devices themselves. We provide an extensive characterization of these surfaces that reveal their effect on the propagation of EM waves. Our evaluation shows that we can enable additional spatial streams using the conductive surface and achieve average throughput gains of 2.6-3x for small devices. Finally, we also leverage the wideband characteristics of these conductive surfaces to demonstrate the first Gbps surface communication system that can directly transfer bits through the surface at up to 1.3Gbps.},

abstract = {Mobile and IoT scenarios increasingly involve interactive and computation intensive contextual recognition. Existing optimizations typically resort to computation offloading or simplified on-device processing. Instead, we observe that the same application is often invoked on multiple devices in close proximity. Moreover, the application instances often processsimilar contextual data that map to thesame outcome. In this paper, we proposecross-device approximate computation reuse, which minimizes redundant computation by harnessing the "equivalence'' between different input values and reusing previously computed outputs with high confidence. We devise adaptive locality sensitive hashing (A-LSH) and homogenized k nearest neighbors (H-kNN). The former achieves scalable and constant lookup, while the latter provides high-quality reuse and tunable accuracy guarantee. We further incorporate approximate reuse as a service, called name, in the computation offloading runtime. Extensive evaluation shows that, when given 95% accuracy target, name consistently harnesses over 90% of reuse opportunities, which translates to reduced computation latency and energy consumption by a factor of 3 to 10.},

abstract = {The advances in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology have empowered mobile operators to deploy LTE base stations (BSs) on UAVs, and provide on-demand, adaptive connectivity to hotspot venues as well as emergency scenarios. However, today's evolved packet core (EPC) that orchestrates the LTE RAN faces fundamental limitations in catering to such a challenging, wireless and mobile UAV environment, particularly in the presence of multiple BSs (UAVs). In this work, we argue for and propose an alternate, radical edge EPC design, called SkyCore that pushes the EPC functionality to the extreme edge of the core network - collapses the EPC into a single, light-weight, self-contained entity that is co-located with each of the UAV BS. SkyCore incorporates elements that are designed to address the unique challenges facing such a distributed design in the UAV environment, namely the resource-constraints of UAV platforms, and the distributed management of pronounced UAV and UE mobility. We build and deploy a fully functional version of SkyCore on a two-UAV LTE network and showcase its (i) ability to interoperate with commercial LTE BSs as well as smartphones, (ii) support for both hotspot and standalone multi-UAV deployments, and (iii) superior control and data plane performance compared to other EPC variants in this environment.},

With a few near-infrared (NIR) lights and photodiodes around the eye, NIR lights sequentially illuminate the eye from various directions while photodiodes sense spatial patterns of reflected light, which are used to infer pupil's position and diameter on the fly via a lightweight inference algorithm. The system also exploits characteristics of different eye movement stages and adjusts its sensing and computation accordingly for further energy savings. A prototype is built with off-the-shelf hardware components and integrated into a regular pair of glasses. Experiments with 22 participants show that the system achieves 0.8-mm mean error in tracking pupil position (2.3 mm at the 95th percentile) and 0.3-mm mean error in tracking pupil diameter (0.9 mm at the 95th percentile) at 120-Hz output frame rate, consuming 395 µW mean power supplied by two small, thin solar cells on glasses side arms.},

abstract = {Flare is a practical system for streaming 360-degree videos on commodity mobile devices. It takes a viewport-adaptive approach, which fetches only portions of a panoramic scene that cover what a viewer is about to perceive. We conduct an IRB-approved user study where we collect head movement traces from 130 diverse users to gain insights on how to design the viewport prediction mechanism for Flare. We then develop novel online algorithms that determine which spatial portions to fetch and their corresponding qualities. We also innovate other components in the streaming pipeline such as decoding and server-side transmission. Through extensive evaluations (~400 hours' playback on WiFi and ~100 hours over LTE), we show that Flare significantly improves the QoE in real-world settings. Compared to non-viewport-adaptive approaches, Flare yields up to 18x quality level improvement on WiFi, and achieves high bandwidth reduction (up to 35%) and video quality enhancement (up to 4.9x) on LTE.},

abstract = {Mobile vision systems such as smartphones, drones, and augmented-reality headsets are revolutionizing our lives. These systems usually run multiple applications concurrently and their available resources at runtime are dynamic due to events such as starting new applications, closing existing applications, and application priority changes. In this paper, we present NestDNN, a framework that takes the dynamics of runtime resources into account to enable resource-aware multi-tenant on-device deep learning for mobile vision systems. NestDNN enables each deep learning model to offer flexible resource-accuracy trade-offs. At runtime, it dynamically selects the optimal resource-accuracy trade-off for each deep learning model to fit the model's resource demand to the system's available runtime resources. In doing so, NestDNN efficiently utilizes the limited resources in mobile vision systems to jointly maximize the performance of all the concurrently running applications. Our experiments show that compared to the resource-agnostic status quo approach, NestDNN achieves as much as 4.2% increase in inference accuracy, 2.0\texttimes{} increase in video frame processing rate and 1.7\texttimes{} reduction on energy consumption.},

abstract = {We present DeepCache, a principled cache design for deep learning inference in continuous mobile vision. DeepCache benefits model execution efficiency by exploiting temporal locality in input video streams. It addresses a key challenge raised by mobile vision: the cache must operate under video scene variation, while trading off among cacheability, overhead, and loss in model accuracy. At the input of a model, DeepCache discovers video temporal locality by exploiting the video's internal structure, for which it borrows proven heuristics from video compression; into the model, DeepCache propagates regions of reusable results by exploiting the model's internal structure. Notably, DeepCache eschews applying video heuristics to model internals which are not pixels but high-dimensional, difficult-to-interpret data. Our implementation of DeepCache works with unmodified deep learning models, requires zero developer's manual effort, and is therefore immediately deployable on off-the-shelf mobile devices. Our experiments show that DeepCache saves inference execution time by 18% on average and up to 47%. DeepCache reduces system energy consumption by 20% on average.},

abstract = {Virtual assistants, such as Alexa, Google Home, and Siri, are revolutionizing our digital life. In the future, they will provide us with a uniform, fully personalized, natural-language interface to all our diverse data sources, web services and IoT devices. The virtual assistant will become a powerful platform as it sees all our personal data and has great influence over the services and vendors we use. We propose a collaborative research effort to develop open-source virtual assistant technology, in concert with a commercially viable distributed infrastructure that safeguards users' data privacy, supports interoperability, and promotes open competition. To jumpstart this effort, we have developed Almond, a working open-source prototype of distributed virtual assistants. Almond lets users use natural language to share their data, IoT, and services with fine-grain control, while preserving their privacy by keeping data on their own devices. Almond also lets users issue advanced commands that monitor real-time events and connect multiple services together. This research lays the groundwork for the creation of three key open, non-proprietary, collaborative virtual assistant resources: (1) Thingpedia, a repository of virtual assistant skills, (2) LUInet (Linguistic User Interface Network), a neural network that translates natural language into ThingTalk, a virtual assistant programming language, and (3) a Distributed ThingTalk Protocol, DTP, that supports sharing with privacy via cooperating virtual assistants.},

In this paper, we study the important, yet largely unexplored, problem of inter-carrier switching for multi-carrier access. We show that policy conflicts can arise between inter- and intra-carrier switching, resulting in oscillations among carriers in the worst case akin to BGP looping. We derive the conditions under which such oscillations occur for three categories of popular policy, and validate them with Project Fi whenever possible. We provide practical guidelines to ensure loop-freedom and assess them via trace-driven emulations.},

In this paper we present a novel cellular core network architecture, called ECHO, particularly suited to public cloud deployments, where the availability guarantees might be an order of magnitude worse compared to existing (redundant) hardware platforms. We present the design and implementation of our approach and evaluate its functionality on a public cloud platform. Analysis shows ECHO promises higher availability than existing telco solutions.},

As a result, people are able to use data services more freely across Europe. However, the implications roaming solutions have on performance have not been carefully examined. This paper provides an in-depth characterization of the implications of international data roaming within Europe. We build a unique roaming measurement platform using 16 different mobile networks deployed in six countries across Europe. Using this platform, we measure different aspects of international roaming in 3G and 4G networks, including mobile network configuration, performance characteristics, and content discrimination. We find that operators adopt common approaches to implementing roaming, resulting in additional latency penalties of ∼60 ms or more, depending on geographical distance. Considering content accessibility, roaming poses additional constraints that leads to only minimal deviations when accessing content in the original country. However, geographical restrictions in the visited country make the picture more complicated and less intuitive.},

abstract = {By providing especially tailored instances of a virtual network,network slicing allows for a strong specialization of the offered services on the same shared infrastructure. Network slicing has profound implications on resource management, as it entails an inherent trade-off between: (i) the need for fully dedicated resources to support service customization, and (ii) the dynamic resource sharing among services to increase resource efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the system. In this paper, we provide a first investigation of this trade-off via an empirical study of resource management efficiency in network slicing. Building on substantial measurement data collected in an operational mobile network (i) we quantify the efficiency gap introduced by non-reconfigurable allocation strategies of different kinds of resources, from radio access to the core of the network, and (ii) we quantify the advantages of their dynamic orchestration at different timescales. Our results provide insights on the achievable efficiency of network slicing architectures, their dimensioning, and their interplay with resource management algorithms.},

abstract = {5G New Radio (NR) is designed to operate under a broad range of frequency bands and support new applications with ultra-low latency. To support its diverse operating conditions, a set of different OFDM numerologies has been defined in the standards body. Under this numerology, it is necessary to perform scheduling with a time resolution of ∼100 μs. This requirement poses a new challenge that does not exist in LTE and cannot be supported by any existing LTE schedulers. In this paper, we present the design of GPF -- a GPU-based proportional fair (PF) scheduler that can meet the ∼100 μs time requirement. The key ideas include decomposing the scheduling problem into a large number of small and independent sub-problems and selecting a subset of sub-problems from the most promising search space to fit into a GPU. By implementing GPF on an off-the-shelf Nvidia Quadro P6000 GPU, we show that GPF is able to achieve near-optimal performance while meeting the ∼100 $mathrmμs time requirement. GPF represents the first successful design of a GPU-based PF scheduler that can meet the new time requirement in NR.},

Future wireless networks will support 100 Gbps communication between people, devices, and the "Internet of Things," with high reliability and uniform coverage indoors and out. The shortage of spectrum to support such systems will be alleviated by advances in massive MIMO and mmW technology as well as cognitive radios. Wireless technology will also enable smart and energy-efficient homes and buildings, automated highways and skyways, and in-body networks for monitoring, analysis and treatment of medical conditions. Breakthrough energy-efficiency architectures, algorithms and hardware will allow wireless networks to be powered by tiny batteries, energy-harvesting, or over-the-air power transfer. Finally, new communication systems based on biology and chemistry to encode bits will enable a wide range of new micro and macroscale applications.

Unfortunately, establishing multi-stream directional links can be a high overhead procedure as the search space increases with the number of spatial streams and the product of AP-client beam resolution. In this paper, we present MUlti-stream beam-Training for mm-wavE networks (MUTE) a novel system that leverages channel sparsity, GHz-scale sampling rate, and the knowledge of mm-Wave RF codebook beam patterns to construct a set of candidate beams for multi-stream beam steering. In 60 GHz WLANs, the AP establishes and maintains a directional link with every client through periodic beam training. MUTE repurposes these beam acquisition sweeps to estimate the Power Delay Profile (PDP) of each beam with zero additional overhead. Coupling PDP estimates with beam pattern knowledge, MUTE selects a set of candidate beams that capture diverse or ideally orthogonal paths to obtain maximum stream separability. Our experiments demonstrate that MUTE achieves 90% of the maximum achievable aggregate rate while incurring only 0.04% of exhaustive search's training overhead.},

abstract = {Beamforming is vital to overcome the high attenuation in wireless millimeter-wave networks. It enables nodes to steer their antennas in the direction of communication. To cope with complexity and overhead, the IEEE 802.11ad standard uses a sector codebook with distinct steering directions. In current off-the-shelf devices, we find codebooks with generic pre-defined beam patterns. While this approach is simple and robust, the antenna modules that are typically deployed in such devices are capable of generating much more precise antenna beams. In this paper, we adaptively adjust the sector codebook of IEEE 802.11ad devices to optimize the transmit beam patterns for the current channel. To achieve this, we propose a mechanism to extract full channel state information (CSI) regarding phase and magnitude from coarse signal strength readings on off-the-shelf IEEE 802.11ad devices. Since such devices do not expose the CSI directly, we generate a codebook with phase-shifted probing beams that enables us to obtain the CSI by combining strategically selected magnitude measurements. Using this CSI, transmitters dynamically compute a transmit beam pattern that maximizes the signal strength at the receiver. Thereby, we automatically exploit reflectors in the environment and improve the received signal quality. Our implementation of this mechanism on off-the-shelf devices demonstrates that adaptive codebook optimization achieves a significantly higher throughput of about a factor of two in typical real-world scenarios.},

Very short wavelength, high directionality, together with sensitivity to rampant blockages and mobility, however, render state-of-the-art mmWave technologies unsuitable for ubiquitous wireless coverage. In this work, we design and implement UbiG - a mmWave wireless access network - that can deliver ubiquitous gigabits per second wireless access consistently to the commercial-off-the-shelf IEEE 802.11ad devices. UbiG has two key design components: (1) a fast probing based beam alignment algorithm that can identify the best beam consistently with guaranteed latency in a mmWave link, and the algorithm scales well even with a very large number of beams; and (2) an infrastructure-side predictive ranking based fast access point switching algorithm to ensure seamless gigabits per second connectivity under mobility and blockage in a dense mmWave deployment. Our IEEE 802.11ad testbed experiments show that UbiG performs close to an "Oracle" solution that instantaneously knows the best beam and access point for gigabits per second data transmission to users.},

abstract = {Driven by a wide range of real-world applications, significant efforts have recently been made to explore device-free human activity recognition techniques that utilize the information collected by various wireless infrastructures to infer human activities without the need for the monitored subject to carry a dedicated device. Existing device free human activity recognition approaches and systems, though yielding reasonably good performance in certain cases, are faced with a major challenge. The wireless signals arriving at the receiving devices usually carry substantial information that is specific to the environment where the activities are recorded and the human subject who conducts the activities. Due to this reason, an activity recognition model that is trained on a specific subject in a specific environment typically does not work well when being applied to predict another subject's activities that are recorded in a different environment. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose EI, a deep-learning based device free activity recognition framework that can remove the environment and subject specific information contained in the activity data and extract environment/subject-independent features shared by the data collected on different subjects under different environments. We conduct extensive experiments on four different device free activity recognition testbeds: WiFi, ultrasound, 60 GHz mmWave, and visible light. The experimental results demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed EI framework.},

abstract = {We present CrossSense, a novel system for scaling up WiFi sensing to new environments and larger problems. To reduce the cost of sensing model training data collection, CrossSense employs machine learning to train, off-line, a roaming model that generates from one set of measurements synthetic training samples for each target environment. To scale up to a larger problem size, CrossSense adopts a mixture-of-experts approach where multiple specialized sensing models, or experts, are used to capture the mapping from diverse WiFi inputs to the desired outputs. The experts are trained offline and at runtime the appropriate expert for a given input is automatically chosen. We evaluate CrossSense by applying it to two representative WiFi sensing applications, gait identification and gesture recognition, in controlled single-link environments. We show that CrossSense boosts the accuracy of state-of-the-art WiFi sensing techniques from 20% to over 80% and 90% for gait identification and gesture recognition respectively, delivering consistently good performance - particularly when the problem size is significantly greater than that current approaches can effectively handle.},

abstract = {User authentication on smartphones must satisfy both security and convenience, an inherently difficult balancing art. Apple's FaceID is arguably the latest of such efforts, at the cost of additional hardware (e.g., dot projector, flood illuminator and infrared camera). We propose a novel user authentication system EchoPrint, which leverages acoustics and vision for secure and convenient user authentication, without requiring any special hardware. EchoPrint actively emits almost inaudible acoustic signals from the earpiece speaker to "illuminate" the user's face and authenticates the user by the unique features extracted from the echoes bouncing off the 3D facial contour. To combat changes in phone-holding poses thus echoes, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to extract reliable acoustic features, which are further combined with visual facial landmark locations to feed a binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for final authentication. Because the echo features depend on 3D facial geometries, EchoPrint is not easily spoofed by images or videos like 2D visual face recognition systems. It needs only commodity hardware, thus avoiding the extra costs of special sensors in solutions like FaceID. Experiments with 62 volunteers and non-human objects such as images, photos, and sculptures show that EchoPrint achieves 93.75% balanced accuracy and 93.50% F-score, while the average precision is 98.05%, and no image/video based attack is observed to succeed in spoofing.},

Such eavesdroppers employ passive receivers that only listen and never transmit any signals making them very hard to detect. In this paper, we show that even passive receivers leak RF signals on the wireless medium. This RF leakage, however, is extremely weak and buried under noise and other transmitted signals that can be 3-5 orders of magnitude larger. Hence, it is missed by today's radios. We design and build Ghostbuster, the first device that can reliably extract this leakage, even when it is buried under ongoing transmissions, in order to detect the hidden presence of eavesdroppers. Ghostbuster does not require any modifications to current transmitters and receivers and can accurately detect the eavesdropper in the presence of ongoing transmissions. Empirical results show that Ghostbuster can detect eavesdroppers with more than 95% accuracy up to 5 meters away.},

The method is implemented in a hardware token worn on user's body, for example in the form of a wristband, which interacts with a receiver embedded inside the touched device through a body-guided channel established when the user touches the device. Experiments show low-power (uJ/bit) operation while achieving superior resilience to attacks, with the received signal at the intended receiver through the body channel being at least 20dB higher than that of an adversary in cm range.},

abstract = {Caller ID spoofing forges the authentic caller identity, thus making the call appear to originate from another user. This seemingly simple attack technique has been used in the growing telephony frauds and scam calls, resulting in substantial monetary loss and victim complaints. Unfortunately, caller ID spoofing is easy to launch, yet hard to defend; no effective and practical defense solutions are in place to date. In this paper, we propose CEIVE (Callee-only inference and verification), an effective and practical defense against caller ID spoofing. It is a victim callee only solution without requiring additional infrastructure support or changes on telephony systems. We formulate the design as an inference and verification problem. Given an incoming call, CEIVE leverages a callback session and its associated call signaling observed at the phone to infer the call state of the other party. It further compares with the anticipated call state, thus quickly verifying whether the incoming call comes from the originating number. We exploit the standardized call signaling messages to extract useful features, and devise call-specific verification and learning to handle diversity and extensibility. We implement CEIVE on Android phones and test it with all top four US mobile carriers, one landline and two small carriers. It shows 100% accuracy in almost all tested spoofing scenarios except one special, targeted attack case.},

It was believed that if an attacker can replay the exact same reply signal of a legitimate authentication object (such as an RFID tag), any physical-layer authentication method will fail. This paper presents Hu-Fu, the first physical layer RFID authentication protocol that is resilient to the major attacks including tag counterfeiting, signal replay, signal compensation, and brute-force feature reply. Hu-Fu is built on two fundamental ideas, namely inductive coupling of two tags and signal randomization. Hu-Fu does not require any hardware or protocol modification on COTS passive tags and can be implemented with COTS devices. We implement a prototype of Hu-Fu and demonstrate that it is accurate and robust to device diversity and environmental changes, including locations, distance, and temperature. Hu-Fu provides a new direction of battery-free/low-power device authentication that enables numerous IoT applications.},

abstract = {Mobile two-factor authentication (2FA) has become commonplace along with the popularity of mobile devices. Current mobile 2FA solutions all require some form of user effort which may seriously affect the experience of mobile users, especially senior citizens or those with disability such as visually impaired users. In this paper, we propose Proximity-Proof, a secure and usable mobile 2FA system without involving user interactions. Proximity-Proof automatically transmits a user's 2FA response via inaudible OFDM-modulated acoustic signals to the login browser. We propose a novel technique to extract individual speaker and microphone fingerprints of a mobile device to defend against the powerful man-in-the-middle (MiM) attack. In addition, Proximity-Proof explores two-way acoustic ranging to thwart the co-located attack. To the best of our knowledge, Proximity-Proof is the first mobile 2FA scheme resilient to the MiM and co-located attacks. We empirically analyze that Proximity-Proof is at least as secure as existing mobile 2FA solutions while being highly usable. We also prototype Proximity-Proof and confirm its high security, usability, and efficiency through comprehensive user experiments.},

This paper introduces an open platform for experimenting with fine time measurements and a general, repeatable, and accurate measurement framework for evaluating time-based ranging systems. We analyze the key factors and parameters that affect the ranging performance and revisit standard error correction techniques for WiFi time-based ranging system. The results confirm that meter-level ranging accuracy is possible as promised, but the measurements also show that this can only be consistently achieved in low-multipath environments such as open outdoor spaces or with denser access point deployments to enable ranging at or above 80 MHz bandwidth.},

Applications of these techniques are in indoor localization, gesture recognition, inventory tracking, vehicular motion, and many others. This paper identifies room for improvement over today's motion tracking techniques. The core observation is that conventional systems have trusted gravity more than the magnetic North to infer the 3D orientation of the object. We find that the reverse is more effective, especially when the object is in continuous fast motion. We leverage this opportunity to design MUSE, a magnetometer-centric sensor fusion algorithm for orientation tracking. Moreover, when the object's motion is somewhat restricted (e.g., human-arm motion restricted by elbow and shoulder joints), we find new methods of sensor fusion to fully leverage the restrictions. Real experiments across a wide range of uncontrolled scenarios show consistent improvement in orientation and location accuracy, without requiring any training or machine learning. We believe this is an important progress in the otherwise mature field of IMU-based motion tracking.},

abstract = {Visible Light Positioning (VLP) has attracted much research effort recently. Most existing VLP approaches require special designed light or receiver, collecting light information or strict user operation (e.g., horizontally holding mobile phone). This incurs a high deployment, maintenance and usage overhead. We present RainbowLight, a low cost ambient light 3D localization approach easy to deploy in today's buildings. Our key finding is that light through a chip of polarizer and birefringence material produces specific interference and light spectrum at different directions to the chip. We derive a model to characterize the relation for direction, light interference and spectrum. Exploiting the model, RainbowLight calculates the direction to a chip after taking a photo containing the chip. With multiple chips, RainbowLight designs a direction intersection based method to derive the location. We implement RainbowLight and extensively evaluate its performance in various environments. The evaluation results show that RainbowLight achieves an average localization error of 3.3 cm in 2D and 9.6 cm in 3D for light on, and an error of 7.4 cm in 2D and 20.5 cm in 3D for light off scenario in daytime.},

It is an applied field focused on the science to characterize, understand, and forecast cyber-mediated changes in human behavior and activity, and the related social, cultural, economic and political outcomes. From the engineering side it is concerned with building the cyber-infrastructure needed for society to persist in its essential character in a cyber-mediated information environment under changing conditions, in the presence of actual or imminent social cyber-threats. Research in social cyber-security has demonstrated that social media and personalized data assistants are critical technologies that affect the ways humans navigate this cyber-mediated information space, and the way they interact and engage in discussions. This impact is complex and is related to the human socio-cognitive response, engineered features of the technologies, and the policy/legal environment in which humans and technology interact. The changing nature of interaction in the cyber-mediated information environment are creating new scientific and policy challenges that those in social cyber-security must address. This talk will describe the nature, promise of, and challenges in social cyber-security. The role of network science and AI, as to of the core methodologies, in addressing these challenges is addressed. Illustrative examples will be drawn from areas such as disaster response, state stability, and the distribution of false information.},

abstract = {Passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tags are ubiquitous today due to their low cost (a few cents), relatively long communication range ($sim$7-11~m), ease of deployment, lack of battery, and small form factor. Hence, they are an attractive foundation for environmental sensing. Although RFID-based sensors have been studied in the research literature and are also available commercially, manufacturing them has been a technically-challenging task that is typically undertaken only by experienced researchers. In this paper, we show how even hobbyists can transform commodity RFID tags into sensors by physically altering (`hacking') them using COTS sensors, a pair of scissors, and clear adhesive tape. Importantly, this requires no change to commercial RFID readers. We also propose a new legacy-compatible tag reading protocol called Differential Minimum Response Threshold (DMRT) that is robust to the changes in an RF environment. To validate our vision, we develop RFID-based sensors for illuminance, temperature, touch, and gestures. We believe that our approach has the potential to open up the field of batteryless backscatter-based RFID sensing to the research community, making it an exciting area for future work.},

abstract = {Parallel backscatter is a promising technique for high throughput, low power communications. The existing approaches of parallel backscatter are based on a common assumption, i.e. the states of the collided signals are distinguishable from each other in either the time domain or the IQ (the In-phase and Quadrature) domain. We in this paper disclose the superclustering phenomenon, which invalidates that assumption and seriously affects the decoding performance. Then we propose an interstellar travelling model to capture the bursty Gaussian process of a collided signal. Based on this model, we design Hubble, a reliable signal processing approach to support parallel backscatter in the wild. Hubble addresses several technical challenges: (i) a novel scheme based on Pearson's Chi-Square test to extract the collided signals' combined states, (ii) a Markov driven method to capture the law of signal state transitions, and (iii) error correction schemes to guarantee the reliability of parallel decoding. Theoretically, Hubble is able to decode all the backscattered data, as long as the signals are detectable by the receiver. The experiment results demonstrate that the median throughput of Hubble is $11.7times$ higher than that of the state-of-the-art approach.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the performance of systems which use commercial wireless devices to make bistatic RF channel measurements for non-contact respiration sensing. Published research has typically presented results from short controlled experiments on one system. In this paper, we deploy an extensive real-world comparative human subject study. We observe twenty patients during their overnight sleep (a total of 160 hours), during which contact sensors record ground-truth breathing data, patient position is recorded, and four different RF breathing monitoring systems simultaneously record measurements. We evaluate published methods and algorithms. We find that WiFi channel state information measurements provide the most robust respiratory rate estimates of the four RF systems tested. However, all four RF systems have periods during which RF-based breathing estimates are not reliable.},

abstract = {Backscatter communication offers a cost- and energy-efficient means for IoT sensor data exchange. The IoT vision for ubiquitous interconnection, in practice, demands multi-hop connectivity for robust and scalable sensor networks, as well as compatibility with such prevailing wireless technologies as WiFi. Today's backscatter solutions however typically follow a single-hop paradigm, i.e., tags do not relay for each other. This paper presents X-Tandem, a multi-hop backscatter system that works with commodity WiFi devices. For the first time, we demonstrate that sensing tags can not only work as relays for each other but also modulate their sensing data into a single backscatter packet, which remains a legit WiFi packet that can be decoded with any commercial WiFi NICs. We discuss the design details of X-Tandem and have built a prototype with FPGAs and off-the-shelf WiFi devices. The prototype demonstrates a two-hop implementation, achieving a throughput up to 200 bps with tag-to-tag distances up to 0.4 m and communication ranges up to 8 m. Compared to single-hop solutions, X-Tandem can improve backscatter throughput by more than 10x in challenging indoor environments with obstacles.},

abstract = {An increasing amount of mobile analytics is performed on data that is procured in a real-time fashion to make real-time decisions. Such tasks include simple reporting on streams to sophisticated model building. However, the practicality of these analyses are impeded in several domains because they are faced with a fundamental trade-off between data collection latency and analysis accuracy. In this paper, we first study this trade-off in the context of a specific domain, Cellular Radio Access Networks (RAN). We find that the trade-off can be resolved using two broad, general techniques: intelligent data grouping and task formulations that leverage domain characteristics. Based on this, we present CellScope, a system that applies a domain specific formulation and application of Multi-task Learning (MTL) to RAN performance analysis. It uses three techniques: feature engineering to transform raw data into effective features, a PCA inspired similarity metric to group data from geographically nearby base stations sharing performance commonalities, and a hybrid online-offline model for efficient model updates. Our evaluation shows that CellScope's accuracy improvements over direct application of ML range from 2.5\texttimes{} to 4.4\texttimes{} while reducing the model update overhead by up to 4.8\texttimes{}. We have also used CellScope to analyze an LTE network of over 2 million subscribers, where it reduced troubleshooting efforts by several magnitudes. We then apply the underlying techniques in CellScope to another domain specific problem, mobile phone energy bug diagnosis, and show that the techniques are general.},

Apple first introduced AWDL around 2014 and has since integrated it into its entire product line, including iPhone and Mac. While we have found that AWDL drives popular applications such as AirPlay and AirDrop on more than one billion end-user devices, neither the protocol itself nor potential security and Wi-Fi coexistence issues have been studied. In this paper, we present the operation of the protocol as the result of binary and runtime analysis. In short, each AWDL node announces a sequence of Availability Windows (AWs) indicating its readiness to communicate with other AWDL nodes. An elected master node synchronizes these sequences. Outside the AWs, nodes can tune their Wi-Fi radio to a different channel to communicate with an access point, or could turn it off to save energy. Based on our analysis, we conduct experiments to study the master election process, synchronization accuracy, channel hopping dynamics, and achievable throughput. We conduct a preliminary security assessment and publish an open source Wireshark dissector for AWDL to nourish future work.},

abstract = {Network connectivity is often one of the most challenging aspects of deploying sensors. In many countries, cellular networks provide the most reliable, highest bandwidth, and greatest coverage option for Internet access. While this makes smartphones a seemingly ideal platform to serve as a gateway between sensors and the cloud, we find that a device designed for multi-tenant operation and frequent human interaction becomes unreliable when tasked to continuously run a single application with no human interaction, a seemingly counter-intuitive result. Further, we find that economy phones cannot physically withstand continuous operation, resulting in a surprisingly high rate of permanent device failures in the field. If these observations hold more broadly, they would make mobile phones poorly suited to a range of sensing applications for which they have been rumored to hold great promise.},

abstract = {Increasingly, vehicles sold today are connected cars: they offer vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity through built-in WiFi and cellular interfaces, and they act as mobile hotspots for devices in the vehicle. We study the connection quality available to connected cars today, focusing on user-facing, latency-sensitive applications. We find that network latency varies significantly and unpredictably at short time scales and that high tail latency substantially degrades user experience. We also find an increase in coverage options available due to commercial WiFi offerings and that variations in latency across network options are not well-correlated. Based on these findings, we develop RAVEN, an in-kernel MPTCP scheduler that mitigates tail latency and network unpredictability by using redundant transmission when confidence about network latency predictions is low. RAVEN has several novel design features. It operates transparently, without application modification or hints, to improve interactive latency. It seamlessly supports three or more wireless networks. Its in-kernel implementation allows proactive cancellation of transmissions made unnecessary through redundancy. Finally, it explicitly considers how the age of measurements affects confidence in predictions, allowing better handling of interactive applications that transmit infrequently and networks that exhibit periods of temporary poor performance. Results from speech, music, and recommender applications in both emulated and live vehicle experiments show substantial improvement in application response time.},

It will consider later efforts in promoting the technology in regions that it had not reached earlier. There will be consideration not only the technical development, but also the political climate which either encouraged or prevented its take-up. Moreover, the importance of personal networks at many stages of the story will be highlighted. I will consider why the first Arpanet service node was sited at UCL, how it grew to provide an international heterogeneous interconnection service until the late '80s, and how this differed from other European developments. This will include the governance put in place, the role of the Open Systems Interconnection rise and fall in Europe, and the growth of multi- agency support on both sides of the Atlantic. In parallel with the development of a UK-US service, an International Collaboration Board (ICB) was formed that fostered unclassified collaborations between certain European and American NATO defence departments. While the ICB was not very significant technically, how its success initiated broader US-European Internet extension will be described. Our emphasis on application services to the '90s will be outlined - message, directory, security and multimedia conferencing. Finally we will treat briefly the start of international networking in India around 1990, and the bringing the academics of Central Asia and the Caucasus into the Internet community.},

abstract = {Hidden screen-camera communication techniques emerge as a new paradigm that embeds data imperceptibly into regular videos while remaining unobtrusive to human viewers. Three key goals on imperceptible, high rate, and reliable communication are desirable but conflicting, and existing solutions usually made a trade-off among them. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of ChromaCode, a screen-camera communication system that achieves all three goals simultaneously. In our design, we consider for the first time color space for perceptually uniform lightness modifications. On this basis, we design an outcome-based adaptive embedding scheme, which adapts to both pixel lightness and regional texture. Last, we propose a concatenated code scheme for robust coding and devise multiple techniques to overcome various screen-camera channel errors. Our prototype and experiments demonstrate that ChromaCode achieves remarkable raw throughputs of &gt;700 kbps, data goodputs of 120 kbps with BER of 0.05, and with fully imperceptible flicker for viewing proved by user study, which significantly outperforms previous works.},

This paper presents a first systematic study on using the electromagnetic field (EMF) induced by a building's electric power network for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). A basis of this work is a measurement study showing that the power network EMF sensed by either a customized sensor or smartphone's microphone as a side-channel sensor is spatially distinct and temporally stable. Based on this, we design a SLAM approach that can reliably detect loop closures based on EMF sensing results. With the EMF feature map constructed by SLAM, we also design an efficient online localization scheme for resource-constrained mobiles. Evaluation in three indoor spaces shows that the power network EMF is a promising modality for location sensing on mobile devices, which is able to run in real time and achieve sub-meter accuracy.},

abstract = {Recent advances in Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) have improved efficient cooperation among heterogeneous wireless devices. To date, however, even the most effective CTC systems require these devices to operate in the same ISM band (e.g., 2.4 GHz) because of the conventional wisdom that wireless transceivers with different (fundamental) frequencies cannot communicate with one another. Our work, which is called TiFi, challenges this belief by allowing a 2.4 GHz WiFi receiver (e.g., a smartphone) to identify UHF RFID tags, which operates at the spectrum between 840 - 920 MHz. TiFi does not require changing current smartphones or tags. Instead, it leverages the underlying harmonic backscattering of tags to open a second channel and uses it to communicate with WiFi receivers. We design and implement TiFi with commodity WiFi chipsets (e.g., Broadcom BCM43xx, Murata KM6D280 40, and Qualcomm WCN3990). Our comprehensive evaluation shows that TiFi allows WiFi receivers to identify UHF RFID tags within the range of 2&nbsp;m and with a median goodput of 95%, which is comparable to today's mobile RFID readers.},

abstract = {Cross-technology Communication (CTC) is a key technique to explore the full capacity of heterogeneous wireless. The latest CTC designs explore the PHY-layer to reach the standards' maximum rate, but leaving a critical gap to practicality -- existing PHY-layer CTCs are commonly transmitter-side techniques requiring a high-end transmitter (with a high degree of freedom in signal manipulation) to emulate the receiver signal closely. This inherently limits the reverse direction (low-end to high-end) communication. We present XBee, a unique receiver-side CTC that fills in the gap and makes a critical step towards achieving CTC bidirectionality. XBee is demonstrated as a ZigBee to BLE communication, where the key innovation lies in the unique mechanism of cross-technology decoding, or cross-decoding in short, which interprets a ZigBee frame only by carefully observing the bit patterns obtained at the BLE receiver. Technically, XBee counterintuitively explores the sampling offset to overcome the intrinsic challenge due to BLE's narrower bandwidth (1MHz) than ZigBee (2MHz). Extensive implementation and evaluation on USRP and commodity devices reach 250 kbps under 85% reliability, a 15,000x improvement over state-of-the-art ZigBee to BLE communication, and comparable with the latest PHY-layer CTCs to achieve CTC bidirectionality.},

abstract = {This tutorial provides students with a basic understanding of the challenges involved in designing RF-powered RF-connected integrated circuits (ICs) with on-chip antennas (OCAs). The tutorial begins by discussing the potential cost and performance advantages of creating ICs with OCAs. The design of ICs in which the antenna and conventional circuitry are all fabricated on the same substrate offers advantages in terms of size, weight and cost over conventional RFID/sensor systems in which an IC is assembled onto an antenna substrate; however, it is challenging because the limited size of the antenna set by the die size and its proximity to a resistive ground plane (the IC substrate) both decrease the RF energy that can be harvested to operate the on-chip circuitry. In this Tutorial, we will apply simplifying approximations in order to develop basic equations relating the size and geometry of the antennas to the ability of the OCA-IC to harvest ambient RF energy; and, we will validate those equations with electromagnetic field simulations. The tutorial will also examine the challenging issue of matching the antenna to the on-chip electronics in a way that maximizes the power that can be extracted from an external RF signal. The Tutorial will consider operation across a range of frequencies and will explore both in-plane spiral antennas and out-of-plane helical antennas. The Tutorial will conclude with an analysis of the case when an OCA-ICs is integrated into medicines in order to provide secure validation of medicinal pills and capsules.},

abstract = {This half-day tutorial will explore edge computing through hands-on development activities using a physical edge computing platform. With the recent trends in the networking ecosystem-the rise of IoT devices, high bandwidth wireless, and powerful, energy-efficient, and inexpensive computation-edge computing is a promising technology for highly interactive and immersive environments. This tutorial aims to promote awareness of the possibilities of edge computing in general and introduce attendees to the tools that they can use to begin exploring this space. The tutorial's activities will give attendees hands-on experience with the ParaDrop edge computing platform developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. We hope to impart working knowledge about edge computing and our vision for its future. Recent developments in home wireless networks such as the proliferation of connected devices (e.g. Internet-of-Things) and gigabit wireless (e.g. 802.11ac) create an environment where edge computing can truly enhance applications. The availability of low latency and high bandwidth at the network edge but not necessarily end-to-end to the cloud, can enable interesting new applications involving video (e.g. augmented reality), low latency sensor-actuator coordination, and other public safety or educational applications. However, before such applications emerge, there needs to be a platform available for them. We argue that the availability of widespread platforms and standards for edge computing will unleash a new wave of innovation much like the creation of app markets for mobile devices. The hardware exists, e.g. in the form of millions of always-on Wi-Fi routers in homes and businesses, but it is not very programmable. With our tutorial, we aim to foster awareness of the possibilities that exist with edge computing and promote the advancement of research toward good standards for its realization. We introduce the ParaDrop platform as an open source demonstration of our vision for edge computing. We have been single-mindedly focused on researcher and developer needs in creating the ParaDrop platform. As such, applications that are already written to be run as cloud services can be easily modified to run on the ParaDrop platform in order to benefit from running at the network edge. Applications are not required to be written in a highly specialized language, and applications are able to leverage the rapidly growing software ecosystem surrounding Docker. Our tutorial will give researchers a hands-on experience with the platform and knowledge that they will be able to use beyond the workshop.},

abstract = {The aim of this tutorial is to give the audience an overview of the landscape of the future generation of mobile networks, namely 5G. Contrary to popular view, 5G is not expected to be anchored on a single disruptive technology but rather supported by an amalgamation of multiple technologies. In essence, it is an evolution of several key technical advancements, whose synergy is expected to revolutionize the heterogeneity of use cases that can be "simultaneously" enabled by a single network. Such use cases range from throughput-focused mobile broadband (Gigabit peak rates) to latency/reliability-focused mission critical (e.g. augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving) and density-focused massive connection (IoT) services. While physical layer advancements in the form of New Radio (NR) are an integral part of 5G, realizing the diverse use cases envisioned, will equally require innovation and flexible orchestration of its access, network and computing layers as well. This tutorial will provide an overview of some of these innovative ingredients that will constitute 5G, from the perspective of not just radio access network, but also core network and services/applications.},

abstract = {Network analytics are widely used in many fields. Increasingly though, the networks of interest are high dimensional. Rather than just focusing on the traditional who is interaction with whom networks, modern network analysis examines the who, what, where, when and why ecology of relations. For example, studies of organizations might look at the social network within the organization as well as the task assignment and knowledge network. Studies using Twitter frequently look at the mentions network at the same time as the hashtag network. Making network science actionable typically involves answering questions about where the network is concentrated or how the network varies over time. This tutorial will cover the basics of Network analytics and demonstrate the use of ORA to support social media analytics using high dimensional network analytics and visualization for social media networks, semantic networks, geo-spatial networks, and dynamic networks. It will cover the basics of visualizing and analyzing time varying networks and spatially positioned networks.

abstract = {Close physical proximity among wireless devices that have never shared a secret key is sometimes used as a basis of trust. In these cases, devices in close proximity are deemed trustworthy while more distant devices are viewed as potential adversaries. Because radio waves are invisible, however, a user may believe a wireless device is communicating with a nearby device when in fact the user's device is communicating with a distant adversary. Researchers have previously proposed methods for multi-antenna devices to ascertain physical proximity with other devices, but devices with a single antenna, such as those commonly used in the Internet of Things, cannot take advantage of these techniques. We investigate a method for a single-antenna Wi-Fi device to quickly determine proximity with another Wi-Fi device. Our approach leverages the repeating nature Wi-Fi's preamble and the characteristics of a transmitting antenna's near field to detect proximity with high probability. Our method never falsely declares proximity at ranges longer than 14 cm.},

abstract = {With the emergency of IoT, there are many IoT network slices with different network requirements. Most of the current IoT system are specific and non-programmable and therefore their slices are difficult to reuse. It is difficult to meet different QoS requirements especially in IoT system because there are plenty of IoT sensors in IoT system. In this paper, we propose a novel IoT network slicing creation system which based on two emerging SDN and NFV technologies. It provides an easily-operating service creation environment and a service execution environment based on micro service architecture. We implement an IoT muti-flow transmission scenario. After adding subservices and QoS policies into a business process at the design plane, the IoT scenario can run automatically at the execution plane. Experiment results on the scenario show that the numbers of packets per second of different flows are changing gradually depend on QoS policies.},

Wi-Cache is being used to test new ideas for edge caching. Specifically, Wi-Cache is a framework for edge caching which allows caching and delivery of content on WiFi APs.

The computation of MBS and SCBSs thresholds for selection of DC user in downlink is also presented. Further, a framework to select the operating point based on energy, throughput, user density, and SCBSs density is presented.},

abstract = {The continuous decrease in the cost of mobile devices and mobile Internet has triggered an exponential growth of overall IP devices, which has consequently increased the demand for network mobility (NEMO), which is required to ensure seamless connectivity of the mobile devices with the Internet on the go. To support this growing demand, the concept of nested-NEMO has evolved over the past few years. However, due to the inherent architecture of nested-NEMO, it is inefficient in terms of hand-off delay and throughput which hinder it to deploy as a highly scalable network. In this paper, we address the scalability issue of nested-NEMO and propose a hierarchical node attachment process for the mobile devices. The performance of the proposed mechanism has been evaluated where we computed the hand-off delay and throughput and observed that the proposed mechanism supports a considerable degree of scalability as compared to the existing nested network mobility architecture.},

The sensors measure heterogeneous time-varying signals and report their measurements to the central monitoring station which uses them to make control decisions. Due to limited communication capacity, not all sensors can send updates to the monitoring station at all times. The cost of the system pays at any time is a weighted sum of the ages-of-information of the various sensors at that time. The goal is to design scheduling policies which minimize the time-average of this cost. We propose a policy called SQRT-Weight which schedules updates from sensors at a frequency proportional to the square-root of the corresponding weights and show that this policy is asymptotically 8--optimal. In addition, we compare the performance of the SQRT-Weight policy with other natural scheduling policies via simulations.},

CA performance prediction (CAPP) metrics are novel tools that address the problem of appropriate CA selection. However, most CAPP metrics depend upon a variety of factors such as the WMN topology, the type of CA scheme, and connectedness of the underlying graph. In this work, we propose an improved Channel Assignment Link-Weight Metric (iCALM) that is independent of these constraints. To the best of our knowledge, iCALM is the first universal CAPP metric for WMNs. To evaluate iCALM, we design two WMN topologies that conform to the attributes of real-world mesh network deployments, and run rigorous simulations in ns-3. We compare iCALM to four existing CAPP metrics, and demonstrate that it performs exceedingly well, regardless of the CA type, and the WMN layout.},

abstract = {802.11ad links provide data rates up to 6.7 Gbps but remain highly susceptible to blockage and mobility. On the other hand, legacy 802.11ac/n links yield much lower rates but are robust even under dynamic scenarios. In this work, we explore using Multipath TCP (MPTCP) to engage both 802.11ad and 802.11ac interfaces simultaneously for performance speed-up and improved reliability. We show that vanilla MPTCP achieves these goals under static conditions but often results in performance worse than using the faster interface alone under dynamic scenarios. We then design and implement AMuSe, a new MPTCP scheduler that allows MPTCP to perform near-optimally under all scenarios.},

abstract = {Frame aggregation in 802.11n and ac gives higher throughputs because larger aggregates reduce inter-frame timing overheads. When aggregate (A-MPDU) sizes are forced to be smaller the throughput benefit dwindles. During normal operation the A-MPDU sizes fall from the maximum possible due to the loss of individual constituent subframes. In the worst case, the size can be as low as a single subframe. We show that, compared to the worst case, full-sized A-MPDUs can give up to 400% higher throughput for the highest MCS indexes of 802.11ac. In this paper, we explain how fixed block ACK size coupled with subframe retransmission are the main causes of reduction in A-MPDU size. We present the modification in the block ACK mechanism needed to attain larger sizes of aggregates even in the presence of subframe losses.},

abstract = {The mobility of smart and connected devices in Internet of Things brings the challenge of reliable data forwarding. In this work, a relay-node selection method is proposed for mobility-tolerant data forwarding. The proposed relay-node selection method uses the connectivity information in time-varying networks. The connectivity information of IoT devices is modelled using homogeneous Poisson point processes. The connectivity duration information of all the devices with their neighbours is updated continuously. Based on connectivity information, an optimal relay-node is selected as a data forwarding node. The online relay-node selection from a source node to the base station establishes a data forwarding path. The proposed method selects the relay-nodes based on joint optimization of two network parameters, data latency and packet loss risk. The simulation results show that the proposed method significantly improves the data latency and the packet loss risk for data forwarding over time-varying IoT networks.},

abstract = {Data-centric networks provide content instead of address (what vs. where) based communication primitives, and have been argued to be the proper candidate for data dissemination in high mobility vehicular networks (e.g., delivering road side accident video clips to affected drivers in both directions). However, current Medium Access Control (MAC) layers filter incoming frames based on destination addresses, not content. The data-centric network community has resorted to MAC broadcast, with high and greatly varying frame loss rates. We propose V-MAC, a data-centric MAC layer that filters frames by content. It supports one to many multicast at MAC level, and ensures a uniform and controllable small frame loss rate across all receivers, despite their varying reception qualities. We have created a V-MAC prototype using Raspberry Pis and WiFi dongles. Experiments under extremely noisy environment show that it reduces frame loss from 50% (broadcast) to less than 10%, and consistently among multiple receivers.},

Today's Wi-Fi networks may consist of a variety of client devices, ranging from slow legacy 802.11a/b/g to modern and fast 802.11n/ac devices. We describe preliminary findings from a large-scale study obtained from 448 Google Wifi and Google OnHub access points with 2,975 clients. We focus on characterizing the maximum achievable bitrate of heterogeneous wireless links. We also determine the average physical-layer bitrate used on the down link (AP to client) and compare it with the maximum supported bitrate. We find that about 75% of 802.11n and 50% of 802.11ac client devices operate at 75% of their maximum or more and that the bitrates of the remaining devices can be very far from their maximum. These low bitrates could significantly reduce the throughput of high-bitrate devices.},

The duty cycled LTE-U is shown to be fair with Wi-Fi technology by following an ON-OFF cycle for its transmission. However, the effect of LTE-U on the video quality of Wi-Fi users has not been studied in the literature. In this work, we study the video quality performance of a Wi-Fi user in the presence of LTE-U, in a testbed system. Our results show that the parameters that contribute to the video QoE (Quality of Experience) of Wi-Fi users get adversely affected as the fraction of channel utilized by LTE-U increases, but the same is not shown to be true with another Wi-Fi. We found that poor video QoE of Wi-Fi users in the presence of LTE-U is because of a large number of packet collisions and less channel access time due to ON cycle of LTE-U.},

Millimeter wave communication at 60 GHz (WiGig) can meet these requirements, but, it is unreliable due to blockages and beam misalignments. In this poster, we present an idea of using both WiFi and WiGig interfaces to transmit the VR content. We divide a video frame into tiles and prioritize the tiles in the user's field of view. Based on the wireless link conditions, the tiles are encoded with varying qualities and transmitted over either WiFi or WiGig interface.

abstract = {Today's mobile users achieve unsatisfactory quality of experience mainly due to the large network distance to the centralized infrastructure. To improve users' experiences, caching at the wireless access points (APs) has been proposed for bringing the contents closer to users. However, the wireless content placement is challenging as the placement is affected by many realistic constraints, such as a large number of APs, interaction among neighboring APs, various local content popularities. In this paper, we study the wireless caching problem, i.e., which contents should be stored by which APs. First, we fulfil these constraints to formulate our problem and introduce an objective function that maximizes the total cache hit rate of all APs. Next, we prove the NP-hardness of the problem and propose a local distributed caching algorithm to address it. Furthermore, we provide a game theoretic perspective on the problem and prove that the proposed algorithm can converge to the Nash Equilibrium in polynomial time. Finally, we perform simulations on a real-world dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

As a remedy, we design and develop an LAA-LTE transmitter based on a software-defined radio system proposing lightweight but effective Wi-Fi frame detection with which an LAA-LTE device can capture a Wi-Fi preamble by only using LTE's own time-domain samples.

This poster presents LoRaTilt, a system that maintains stability of a UAV using a Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LP-WAN) transmitter. We mount a light-weight and ten-year battery-powered LP-WAN transmitter on a UAV and process its signals from base stations up to hundreds of meter away. We demonstrate how our system estimates and corrects for UAV drift in GPS-denied settings with minimal impact on the cost and flight life of a UAV.

The prototype is specifically designed to be mounted on the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) buses. Movement of the buses adds noise to pollution data. Error in GPS measurement causes issues in detecting moving vs. stationary state of the buses, useful to filter out noisy pollution data collected in the moving state. Intermittent cellular network connectivity causes frequent disconnects with the remote server. Our prototype is designed to handle such real world deployment challenges. Pilot deployment with this platform is currently ongoing. Preliminary data analysis from the pilot deployment will be discussed as part of the poster presentation, along with demonstration of the prototype sensor platform. This hardware prototype has the potential of creating locality wise, dense air pollution data providing crucial insights into the causes of air pollution.},

abstract = {Handheld devices are becoming increasingly common in today's world. With every passing year, the diversity of applications (apps) being supported by mobile platforms is growing manyfold. In addition, Android, the most popular handheld OS in the market is releasing a new version every year, with a newer and richer set of APIs, enabling the next generation of feature-rich applications. To support these apps, hardware requirements of these devices are increasing rapidly. Mobile SoCs need a larger number of faster cores, better GPUs and above all, higher DRAM capacities to do justice to user experience. To augment capacity requirements, non-volatile memories (NVMs) have been proposed as a potential addition to LPDDR variants, which have been the mainstay of mobile SoCs. However, few tools exist to carry out architectural design space exploration of main memory hierarchies featuring NVMs for newer Android and app versions. In this paper, we present META, a trace based tool for facilitating the exploration of memory hierarchies in mobile devices. META uses an enhanced version of Android emulator for generating raw instruction traces. These traces are then fed into a cache hierarchy and memory simulation modules to carry out design space exploration for a wide variety of apps and memory technologies.},

In this paper, we proposed a GPU based High Definition Parallel Video Codec on mobile devices, which is an efficient video codec with the cooperation of CPU and GPU. The video codec system is fully compliant with the video codec h264 standard. Compared with the scheme using existing X264, the presented experimental results evaluated the GPU based video codec achieves appreciable improvements in FPS(frames per second), the energy consumption and utilization of CPU are reduced properly at the same time.},

We explore the uniqueness of the human cardiac system captured by the PPG sensing technology. Existing CA systems require either the dedicated sensing hardware or specific gestures, whereas our system does not require any users' interactions but only the wearable device, which has already been pervasively equipped with PPG sensors. Notably, we design a robust motion artifacts (MA) removal method to mitigate the impact of MA from wrist movements. Additionally, we explore the characteristic fiducial features from PPG measurements to efficiently distinguish the human cardiac system. Furthermore, we develop a cardiac-based classifier for user identification using the Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT). Experiments with the prototype of the wrist-worn PPG sensing platform and 10 participants in different scenarios demonstrate that our system can effectively remove MA and achieve a high average authentication success rate over $90%$.},

Our system innovatively re-uses widely available WiFi signals to capture the unique physiological characteristics rooted in respiratory motions for continuous authentication. Different from existing continuous authentication approaches having limited applicable scenarios due to their dependence on restricted user behaviors (e.g., keystrokes and gaits) or dedicated sensing infrastructures, our approach can be easily integrated into any existing WiFi infrastructure to provide non-invasive continuous authentication independent of user behaviors. Specifically, we extract representative features leveraging waveform morphology analysis and fuzzy wavelet transformation of respiration signals derived from the readily available channel state information (CSI) of WiFi. A respiration-based user authentication scheme is developed to accurately identify users and reject spoofers. Extensive experiments involving 20 subjects demonstrate that the proposed system can achieve a high authentication success rate of over 93% and robustly defend against various types of attacks.},

We present a passcode inference system, which examines to what extent the user's PIN during mobile payment could be revealed from a single wrist-worn wearable device under different input scenarios involving either two hands or a single hand.

This incurs a high deployment, maintenance and usage overhead. In this demo, we present RainbowLight, a low cost ambient light 3D localization approach easy to deploy in today's buildings. Our key finding is that light through a chip of polarizer and birefringence material produces specific interference and light spectrum at different directions to the chip. We derive a model to characterize the relation for direction, light interference and spectrum. Exploiting the model, RainbowLight calculates the direction to a chip after taking a photo containing the chip. With multiple chips, RainbowLight designs a direction intersection based method to derive the location. This demo shows our prototype of implementation, with simple photo capturing and deriving location of camera on mobile phone. The evaluation results show that RainbowLight achieves an average localization error of 3.3 cm in 2D and 9.6 cm in 3D for light on, and an error of 7.4 cm in 2D and 20.5 cm in 3D for light off scenario in daytime.},

abstract = {Narrowband transmitters such as IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee) operating in 2.4 GHz ISM band cause significant degradation of throughput to the co-channel IEEE 802.11g (WiFi). The phenomenon is common in smart factories and smart homes which generously use ZigBee sensors for process monitoring and automation. This interferes with omnipresent WiFi in the same 2.4 GHz ISM band. In our demonstration, we will present Software Defined Radio (SDR) based single antenna and multi-antenna prototype of standard-compliant IEEE 802.11g receiver. Our receiver prototype is capable of significantly reducing the packet error rate while facing multiple co-channel narrowband ZigBee interferers. We also demonstrate a real-time SDR implementation of Soft Bit Maximal Ratio Combiner capable of decoding frames from standard compliant IEEE 802.11g transmitters. This is a first of its kind implementation to the best of author's knowledge. The demonstrations use Ettus B210 as SDR hardware and a combination of signal processing modules from two different SDR packages: GNU Radio and Openairinterface.},

In this demo, we propose RF-iCare, an RFID-based approach for monitoring the infusion status, including the liquid level and the drop speed. With a tag array attached on the infusion bottle, we design an RSSI-based signal match model to estimate the liquid level. With a tag attached on the Murphy's dropper, we leverage the phase variation of the tag to estimate the drop speed. We implement RF-iCare with a COTS RFID system and evaluate it in the real-world hospitals. Our experiments demonstrate that RF-iCare can accurately monitor the completion of the infusion over 91% tests, and estimate the liquid level with the mean accuracy of 0.8 cm as well as the drop speed with the error rate less than 3%.},

We have reverse engineered the protocol and explain its frame format and operation in our MobiCom '18 paper "One Billion Apples' Secret Sauce: Recipe of the Apple Wireless Direct Link Ad hoc Protocol." AWDL builds on the IEEE 802.11 standard and implements election, synchronization, and channel hopping mechanisms on top of it. Furthermore, AWDL features an IPv6-based data path which enables direct communication. To validate our own work, we implement a working prototype of AWDL on Linux-based systems. Our implementation is written in C, runs in userspace, and makes use of Linux's Netlink API for interactions with the system's networking stack and the pcap library for frame injection and reception. In our demonstrator, we show how our Linux system synchronizes to an existing AWDL cluster or takes over the master role itself. Furthermore, it can receive data frames from and send them to a MacBook or iPhone via AWDL. We demonstrate the data exchange via ICMPv6 echo request and replies as well as sending and receiving data over a TCP connection.},

abstract = {Internet-of-Things (IoT) nodes in dense WiFi deployments struggle to maintain their associations with the access points (APs) and efficiently transmit their data. In the process, they waste their energy and airtime, which affects their battery-life and throughput. We present Elixir, a protocol for WiFi-based IoT nodes that enables them to transmit data without the need of a WiFi association. Elixir is implemented in the user space, which makes it easy to port the implementation to any Linux-based client and AP. We demonstrate its end-to-end operation on a Raspberry Pi module in good [signal strengths '40 to '50 dBm and no losses] and bad network conditions [signal strengths below '80 dBm and losses present]. We measure benefits of Elixir in terms of (a) the ability to transmit when the WiFi association cannot be maintained [in bad network condition], (b) lesser number of frames transmitted [50x - good network condition, 100x ? bad network condition], (c) reduced airtime consumption [10x - bad network condition], and (d) reduced battery expenditure [18% for both network conditions].},

abstract = {Recent advances in Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) have improved efficient cooperation among heterogeneous wireless devices. To date, however, even the most effective CTC systems require these devices to operate in the same ISM band (eg. 2.4GHz) because of the conventional wisdom that wireless transceivers with different (fundamental) frequencies cannot communicate with one another. In this demo, we present a practical CTC application, called \o{}ursystem, allowing a 2.4GHz WiFi receiver (eg. a smartphone) to identify UHF RFID tags, which operates at the spectrum between 840~920MHz. \o{}ursystem leverages the underlying harmonic backscattering of tags to open a second channel and uses it to communicate with WiFi receivers. We design and implement \o{}ursystem with commodity WiFi chipsets. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that \o{}ursystem allows WiFi receivers to identify UHF RFID tags within the range of $2$ m and with a median goodput of 95%, which is comparable to today's mobile RFID readers.},

In normal time, EasyGO can estimate the density of indoor people in each area and determine the moving speeds to pass through different areas. Based on the determined moving speed of each area, an indoor navigation path can be planned to provide the shortest moving time for EasyGO users. In emergent time, EasyGO can accurately estimate the escaping time for each EasyGO user by considering the capacity and length of passageways, the capacity of exits, and the current distribution and parallel moving of indoor people. Based on the estimated escaping time, EasyGO can evenly distribute the evacuation load among exits and alleviate the congestion of all passageways and exits to minimize the total escaping time. An Android-based prototype with iBeacon indoor localization is implemented to verify the feasibility of our EasyGO system.},

MegaSense involves a novel hierarchy of multi-vendor distributed air quality sensors, in which accurate sensors calibrate lower cost sensors. Current low-cost air quality sensors suffer from measurement drift and they have low accuracy. We address this significant open problem for dense urban areas by developing a calibration scheme that detects and automatically corrects drift. MegaSense integrates with the 5G cellular network and leverages mobile edge computing for sensor management and distributed pollution map creation. We demonstrate MegaSense with two sensor types, a state of the art air quality monitoring station and a low-cost sensor array, with calibration between the two to improve the accuracy of the low-cost device. Participants can interact with the sensors and see air quality changes in real-time, and observe the mechanism to mitigate sensor drift. Our re-calibration method minimizes the error for NO2 and O3 81% of the time (vs single calibration) and reduces the mean relative error by 25%-45%.},

In many countries, cellular networks provide the most reliable, highest bandwidth, and greatest coverage option for internet access. Repurposing smartphones as gateways could extract value from hundreds of millions of devices currently considered to be e-waste. While these factors make smartphones a seemingly ideal platform to serve as a gateway between sensors and the cloud, we find that a device designed for multi-tenant operation and frequent human interaction becomes unreliable when tasked to continuously run a single application with no human interaction, a somewhat counter-intuitive result. Further, we find that economy phones cannot physically withstand continuous operation, resulting in a surprisingly high rate of permanent device failures in the field. If these observations hold more broadly, they would make mobile phones poorly suited to a range of sensing applications for which they have been rumored to hold great promise.},

D2D has gained considerable attention due to several drawbacks associated with the existing mobile networks such as multi-hop transmission, higher latency, high power consumption and significant path loss. In an underlay D2D communication, both cellular and D2D users coexist by simultaneously sharing the licensed cellular spectrum. However, the performance of an underlay D2D communication is limited by the amount of interference from the cellular user(CU) to the D2D user and vice versa. In this paper, we design and develop a test-bed to evaluate the real-world performance of the underlay D2D communication framework. We demonstrate the impact of interference caused by CU on D2D receiver's throughput at different cellular angles and position with respect to the base station (BS). The demonstration has been performed on National Instruments Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) RIO platform with LTE application framework module of LabVIEW communication system design suite as a supportive Application programming interface (API).},

Inception of LED technology for lighting in 90's paved the way for high growth trajectory for LED Lighting industry which we have witnessed from the last 2 decades. As semiconductors, LEDs were poised to develop much bigger applications like integrated sensors apart from normal dimming and ambient lighting. Li-Fi is a technology which creates a bridge between the world of data communication &amp; LED Lighting. Multiple forward &amp; backward integration are poised to happen in coming years when lighting players will develop enterprise communication enabled lighting products. Even system integrators will look forward to Li-Fi enabled luminaires for establishing wireless networks. Li-Fi is being seen as a big step forward in enabling 5G telecommunication networks. Security benefits and outdoor long-range communication capabilities Li-Fi a potential technology for Defence &amp; Smart Cities applications. Li-Fi uses the visible and invisible frequency band (380nm - 1500nm) which is 10,000 times broader than usable RF frequency band. The property of light spectrum to be unlicensed and free from any health regulations makes it even more desirable for us. Its applications can extend in areas where the RF technology lacks its presence like aircrafts and hospitals (operation theatres), power plants and various other areas, where electromagnetic (Radio) interference is of great concern for safety and security of equipment's and people. Since there is no potential health hazard associated with light, it can be used safely in such locations or areas. Li-Fi / OWC has applications in both indoor (≅) and outdoor ( ) scenarios.},

abstract = {In addition to reducing the environmental footprint, smart energy monitoring systems today should reduce operating costs, provide insights on energy consumption, and manage load distribution. This involves monitoring the overall energy consumption of a facility and the individual energy consumption of each device. This is usually done by using multiple energy meters. Minion, a hand sized energy auditing device, has the ability to analyze multiple devices' energy consumption without the need of multiple energy meters. This allows valuable actionable insights for non-intrusive energy management solution. Minion captures voltage and energy signatures at microsecond intervals and uses machine learning techniques to identify the individual assets used and the patterns of their consumption. Minion enables energy transparency, energy savings of up to 30%, predictive maintenance and asset health monitoring, This provides accurate and rapid analysis of multiple energy signatures at any given point.},

abstract = {Recent advances in Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) have improved efficient coexistence and cooperation among heterogeneous wireless devices (e.g., WiFi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth) operating in the same ISM band. However, until now the effectiveness of existing CTCs, which rely on packet-level modulation, is limited due to their low throughput (e.g., tens of bps). Our work, named WEBee, opens a promising direction for high-throughput CTC via physical-level emulation. WEBee uses a high-speed wireless radio (e.g., WiFi OFDM) to emulate the desired signals of a low-speed radio (e.g., ZigBee). Our unique emulation technique manipulates only the payload of WiFi packets, requiring neither hardware nor firmware changes in commodity technologies -- a feature allowing zero-cost fast deployment on existing WiFi infrastructure. We designed and implemented WEBee with commodity devices (Atheros AR2425 WiFi card and MicaZ CC2420) and the USRP-N210 platform (for PHY layer evaluation). Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that WEBee can achieve a more than 99% reliable parallel CTC between WiFi and ZigBee with 126 Kbps in noisy environments, a throughput about 16,000x faster than current state-of-the-art CTCs.},

abstract = {Traditional signal processing design (e.g., frequency offset and channel estimation) at a receiver treats each packet arrival as an independent process to facilitate decoding and interpreting packet data. In this paper, we enhance the performance of this process in the wireless network domain. We propose STAteful inter-Packet signaL procEssing (STAPLE), a framework of stateful signal processing residing between the physical and link layers. STAPLE transforms the signal processing procedure into a lightweight stateful process that caches in a small-sized memory table physical and link layer header fields as packet state information. The similarity of such information among packets serves as prior knowledge to further enhance the reliability of signal processing and thus improve the wireless network performance. We implement STAPLE on USRP X300-series devices with adapted configurations for 802.11a/b/g/n/ac and 802.15.4. The STAPLE prototype is of low processing complexity and does not change any wireless standard specification. Comprehensive experimental results show that the benefit from STAPLE is universal in various wireless networks.},

abstract = {Despite years of innovative research and development, gigabit-speed 60 GHz wireless networks are still not mainstream. The main concern for network operators and vendors is the unfavorable propagation characteristics due to short wavelength and high directionality, which renders the 60 GHz links highly vulnerable to blockage and mobility. However, the advent of multi-band chipsets opens the possibility of leveraging the more robust WiFi technology to assist 60 GHz in order to provide seamless, Gbps connectivity. In this paper, we design and implement MUST, an IEEE 802.11-compliant system that provides seamless, high-speed connectivity over multi-band 60 GHz and WiFi devices. MUST has two key design components: (1) a WiFi-assisted 60 GHz link adaptation algorithm, which can instantaneously predict the best beam and PHY rate setting, with zero probing overhead; and (2) a proactive blockage detection and switching algorithm which can re-direct ongoing user traffic to the robust interface within sub-10 ms latency. Our experiments with off-the-shelf 802.11 hardware show that MUST can achieve 25-60% throughput gain over state-of-the-art solutions, while bringing almost 2 orders of magnitude cross-band switching latency improvement.},

abstract = {60 GHz millimeter-wave networking has emerged as the next frontier technology to provide multi-Gbps wireless connectivity. However, the intrinsic directionality and limited field-of-view of 60 GHz antennas make the links extremely sensitive to user mobility and orientation change. Hence, seamless coverage, even at room level, becomes challenging. In this paper, we propose Pia, a robust 60 GHz network architecture that can provide seamless coverage and mobility support at multi-Gbps bitrate. Pia comprises multiple cooperating access points (APs). It leverages the pose information on mobile clients to proactively select the AP and manage multi-link spatial reuse. These decisions require a model of the pose/location of the APs and ambient reflectors. We address these challenges through a set of AP-pose sensing and compressive angle estimation algorithms that fuse the pose measurement with link quality measurement on the client. We have implemented Pia using commodity 60 GHz platforms. Our experiments show that Pia reduces the occurrence of link outage by 6.3x and improves the spatial sharing capacity by 76%, compared to conventional schemes that only use in-band information for adaptation.},

The fundamental problem is that, data-plane packet delivery cannot start or resume until all control-plane procedures are completed, and these control procedures run sequentially by design. We show both are more than necessary under popular use cases. We design DPCM, which reduces data access latency through parallel processing approaches and exploiting device-side state replica.

Even more, there is a strong need for objective data about stability and performance of MBB (e.g., 3G/4G) networks, and for tools that rigorously and scientifically assess their status. In this paper, we introduce the MONROE measurement platform: an open access and flexible hardware-based platform for measurements and custom experimentation on operational MBB networks. The MONROE platform enables accurate, realistic and meaningful assessment of the performance and reliability of 11 MBB networks in Europe. We report on our experience designing, implementing and testing the solution we propose for the platform. We detail the challenges we overcame while building and testing the MONROE testbed and argue our design and implementation choices accordingly.

abstract = {The near ubiquitous availability and success of mobile broadband networks has motivated verticals that range from public safety communication to intelligent transportation systems and beyond to consider choosing them as the communication mean of choice. Several of these verticals, however, expect high availability of multiple nines. This paper leverages end-to-end measurements to investigate the potential of current mobile broadband networks to support these expectations. We conduct a large-scale measurement study of network availability in four networks in Norway. This study is based on three years of measurements from hundreds of stationary measurement nodes and several months of measurements from four mobile nodes. We find that the mobile network centralized architecture and infrastructure sharing between operators are responsible for a non-trivial fraction of network failures. Most episodes of degraded availability, however, are uncorrelated. We also find that using two networks simultaneously can result in more than five nines of availability for stationary nodes and three nines of availability for mobile nodes. Our findings point to potential avenues for enhancing the availability of future mobile networks.},

User-defined accelerators offload those tasks, which are either computation-intensive or communication-heavy, or require fine-grained timing control, from the processor, and accelerate them in hardware. Tick applies a number of hardware and software co-design techniques to ensure low latency, including multi-clock-domain pipelining, field-based processing pipeline, separation of data and control flows, etc. We have implemented Tick and validated its effectiveness through extensive evaluations as well as two prototypes of 802.11ac SISO/MIMO and 802.11a/g full-duplex.},

In this paper, we present BiPass to break this limitation.With the help of full duplex capable relays, weenable simultaneous bidirectional in-band cut-through transmissions between two far apart nodes, so they can do full duplex communications as if they were within each other's transmission range.To design such a system, we analyze interference patterns and propose a loop-back interference cancellation strategy. We identify the power amplification problem at relay nodes and develop an algorithm to solve it. We also develop a routing algorithm, an opportunistic forwarding scheme, and a real-time feedback strategy to leverage this system in ad-hoc networks.To evaluate the real world performance of BiPass, we build a prototype and conduct experiments using software defined radios. We show that BiPass can achieve 1.6x median throughput gain over state-of-the-art one-way cut-through systems, and 4.09x gain over the decode-and-forward scheme. Our simulations further reveal that even when the data traffic is not bidirectional, BiPass has 1.36x throughput gain and 47% delay reduction overone-way cut-through systemsin large networks.},

abstract = {Emerging 5G mobile networks are envisioned to become multi-service environments, enabling the dynamic deployment of services with a diverse set of performance requirements, accommodating the needs of mobile network operators, verticals and over-the-top (OTT) service providers. Virtualizing the mobile network in a flexible way is of paramount importance for a cost-effective realization of this vision. While virtualization has been extensively studied in the case of the mobile core, virtualizing the radio access network (RAN) is still at its infancy. In this paper, we present Orion, a novel RAN slicing system that enables the dynamic on-the-fly virtualization of base stations, the flexible customization of slices to meet their respective service needs and which can be used in an end-to-end network slicing setting. Orion guarantees the functional and performance isolation of slices, while allowing for the efficient use of RAN resources among them. We present a concrete prototype implementation of Orion for LTE, with experimental results, considering alternative RAN slicing approaches, indicating its efficiency and highlighting its isolation capabilities. We also present an extension to Orion for accommodating the needs of OTT providers.},

abstract = {Simultaneously using multiple network paths (e.g., WiFi and cellular) is an attractive feature on mobile devices. A key component in a multipath system such as MPTCP is the scheduler, which determines how to distribute the traffic over multiple paths. In this paper, we propose DEMS, a new multipath scheduler aiming at reducing the data chunk download time. DEMS consists of three key design decisions: (1) being aware of the chunk boundary and strategically decoupling the paths for chunk delivery, (2) ensuring simultaneous subflow completion at the receiver side, and (3) allowing a path to trade a small amount of redundant data for performance. We have implemented DEMS on smartphones and evaluated it over both emulated and real cellular/WiFi networks. DEMS is robust to diverse network conditions and brings significant performance boost compared to the default MPTCP scheduler (e.g., median download time reduction of 33%--48% for fetching files and median loading time reduction of 6%--43% for fetching web pages), and even more benefits compared to other state-of-the-art schedulers.},

abstract = {Expected increase in cellular demand has pushed recent interest in picocell networks which have reduced cell sizes (100-200m or less). For ease of deployment of such networks, a wireless backhaul network is highly desired. Since RF-based technologies are unlikely to provide the desired multi-gigabit data rates, we motivate and explore use of free space optics (FSO) for picocell backhaul. In particular, we present a novel network architecture based on steerable links and sufficiently many robust short-range links, to help circumvent the key challenge of outdoor effects in reliable operation of outdoor FSO links. Our architecture is motivated by the fact that, due to the high density of picocells, many short-range links will occur naturally in a picocell backhaul. Moreover, use of steerable FSO links facilitates networks with sufficient redundancy while using only a small number of interfaces per node. We address the key problems that arise in the context of such a backhaul architecture, viz., an FSO link design with desired characteristics, and related network design and management problems. We develop and evaluate a robust 100m FSO link prototype, and simulate the proposed architecture in many metro US cities while show its viability via evaluation of key performance metrics.},

abstract = {Near-field communication (NFC) plays a crucial role in the operation of mobile devices to enhance applications such as payment, social networks, private communication, gaming, and etc. Despite of the convenience, existing NFC standards like ISO-13157 require additional hardware (e.g., loop antenna and dedicated chip) and thereby hindering their wide-scale applications. In this work, we seek to propose a novel near-field communication protocol, MagneComm, which utilizes Magnetic Induction (MI) signals emitted from CPUs and captured by magnetometers on mobile devices for communication. Since CPUs and magnetometers are readily available components in mobile devices, MagneComm eliminates the requirement for special hardware and complements existing near-field communication protocols by providing additional bandwidth. We systematically analyze the characteristics of magnetic signals of CPUs and facilitate MagneComm with one-way communication, full-duplex communication, and multi-transmitter schemes in accordance with the hardware availability on devices. We prototype MagneComm on both laptops and smartphones. Extensive evaluation results show that MagneComm achieves up to 110bps within 10cm.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the feasibility of practical backscatter communication using visible light for battery-free IoT applications. Based on the idea of modulating the light retroreflection with a commercial LCD shutter, we effectively synthesize these off-the-shelf optical components into a sub- mW low power visible light passive transmitter along with a retroreflecting uplink design dedicated for power constrained mobile/IoT devices. On top of that, we design, implement and evaluate PassiveVLC, a novel visible light backscatter communication system. PassiveVLC system enables a battery-free tag device to perform passive communication with the illuminating LEDs over the same light carrier and thus offers several favorable features including battery-free, sniff-proof, and biologically friendly for human-centric use cases. Experimental results from our prototyped system show that PassiveVLC is flexible with tag orientation, robust to ambient lighting conditions, and can achieve up to 1 kbps uplink speed. Link budget analysis and two proof-of-concept applications are developed to demonstrate PassiveVLC's efficacy and practicality.},

abstract = {As a popular approach to implementing Visible Light Communication (VLC) on commercial-off-the-shelf devices, LED-Camera VLC has attracted substantial attention recently. While such systems initially used reflected light as the communication media, direct light becomes the dominant media for the purpose of combating interference. Nonetheless, the data rate achievable by direct light LED-Camera VLC systems has hit its bottleneck: the dimension of the transmitters. In order to further improve the performance, we revisit the reflected light approach and we innovate in converting the potentially destructive interferences into collaborative transmissions. Essentially, our ReflexCode system codes information by superposing light emissions from multiple transmitters. It combines traditional amplitude demodulation with slope detection to "decode" the grayscale modulated signal, and it tunes decoding thresholds dynamically depending on the spatial symbol distribution. In addition, ReflexCode re-engineers the balanced codes to avoid flicker from individual transmitters. We implement ReflexCode as two prototypes and demonstrate that it can achieve a throughput up to 3.2kb/s at a distance of 3m.},

System researchers however also have a responsibility to build systems that can impact practice in the near-term and perhaps, even create a brand new industry. In my talk, I will focus on my efforts so far navigating this chasm between curiosity and impact driven research. Specifically, I will share two research themes I have been working on as an assistant professor at UW CSE, where what initially began as curiosity-driven projects were transformed by the urge to make immediate practical impact as well as be unique. In particular, I will first talk about our journey going from a science-driven project on ambient backscatter (Sigcomm'13) to building wireless backscatter systems that work reliably and address a key pain-point in the industry. Next, I will talk about how we shifted gears from working on wireless gesture recognition (WiSee, Mobicom'13) to addressing a medical need of millions of people in the United States that go undiagnosed from sleep apnea (ApneaApp, Mobisys'15) and our experience licensing our technology to a multi-national medical corporation. Finally, I will share my thoughts on how our research community can help us better navigate this chasm.},

abstract = {The past decade's research in visible light positioning (VLP) has led to technologies with high location precision. However, existing VLP systems either require specialized LEDs which hinder large-scale deployment, or need cameras which preclude continuous localization because of high power consumption and short coverage. In this paper, we propose Pulsar, which uses a compact photodiode sensor, readily fit into a mobile device, to discriminate existing ceiling lights---either fluorescent lights or conventional LEDs---based on their intrinsic optical emission features. To overcome the photodiode's lack of spatial resolution, we design a novel sparse photogrammetry mechanism, which resolves the light source's angle-of-arrival, and triangulates the device's 3D location and even orientation. To facilitate ubiquitous deployment, we further develop a light registration mechanism that automatically registers the ceiling lights' locations as landmarks on a building's floor map. Our experiments demonstrate that Pulsar can reliably achieve decimeter precision in both controlled environment and large-scale buildings.},

abstract = {Long-range low-power localization is a key technology that enables a host of new applications of wireless sensor nodes. We present RF-Echo, a new low-power RF localization solution that achieves decimeter accuracy in long range indoor non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. RF-Echo introduces a custom-designed active RF reflector ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) fabricated in a 180nm CMOS process which echoes a frequency-shifted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal originally generated from an anchor. The proposed technique is based on time-of-flight (ToF) estimation in the frequency domain that effectively eliminates inter-carrier and inter-symbol interference in multipath-rich indoor NLOS channels. RF-Echo uses a relatively narrow bandwidth of $leq$80 MHz which does not require an expensive very high sampling rate analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Unlike ultra-wideband (UWB) systems, the active reflection scheme is designed to operate at a relatively low carrier frequency that can penetrate building walls and other blocking objects for challenging NLOS scenarios. Since the bandwidth at lower frequencies (2.4 GHz and sub-1 GHz) is severely limited, we propose novel signal processing algorithms as well as machine learning techniques to significantly enhance the localization resolution given the bandwidth constraint of the proposed system. The newly fabricated tag IC consumes 62.8 mW active power. The software defined radio (SDR) based anchor prototype is rapidly deployable without the need for accurate synchronization among anchors and tags. Field trials conducted in a university building confirm up to 85 m operation with decimeter accuracy for robust 2D localization.},

abstract = {The current mechanisms for locating spectrum offenders are time consuming, human-intensive, and expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to locate spectrum offenders using crowdsourcing. In such a participatory sensing system, privacy and bandwidth concerns preclude distributed sensing devices from reporting raw signal samples to a central agency; instead, devices would be limited to measurements of received power. However, this limitation enables a smart attacker to evade localization by simultaneously transmitting from multiple infected devices. Existing localization methods are insufficient or incapable of locating multiple sources when the powers from each source cannot be separated at the receivers. In this paper, we first propose a simple and efficient method that simultaneously locates multiple transmitters using the received power measurements from the selected devices. Second, we build sampling approaches to select sensing devices required for localization. Next, we enhance our sampling to also take into account incentives for participation in crowdsourcing. We experimentally evaluate our localization framework under a variety of settings and find that we are able to localize multiple sources transmitting simultaneously with reasonably high accuracy in a timely manner.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art RFID localization systems fall under two categories. The first category operates with off-the-shelf narrowband RFID tags but makes restrictive assumptions on the environment or the tag's movement patterns. The second category does not make such restrictive assumptions; however, it requires designing new ultra-wideband hardware for RFIDs and uses the large bandwidth to directly compute a tag's 3D location. Hence, while the first category is restrictive, the second one requires replacing the billions of RFIDs already produced and deployed annually. This paper presents RFind, a new technology that brings the benefits of ultra-wideband localization to the billions of RFIDs in today's world. RFind does not require changing today's passive narrowband RFID tags. Instead, it leverages their underlying physical properties to emulate a very large bandwidth and uses it for localization. Our empirical results demonstrate that RFind can emulate over 220MHz of bandwidth on tags designed with a communication bandwidth of only tens to hundreds of kHz, while remaining compliant with FCC regulations. This, combined with a new super-resolution algorithm over this bandwidth, enables RFind to perform 3D localization with sub-centimeter accuracy in each of the x/y/z dimensions, without making any restrictive assumptions on the tag's motion or the environment.},

abstract = {In this paper, we design and develop RIO, a novel battery-free touch sensing user interface (UI) primitive for future IoT and smart spaces. RIO enables UIs to be constructed using off-the-shelf RFID readers and tags, and provides a unique approach to designing smart IoT spaces. With RIO, any surface can be turned into a touch-aware surface by simply attaching RFID tags to them. RIO also supports custom-designed RFID tags, and thus allows specially customized UIs to be easily deployed into a real-world environment. RIO is built using the technique of impedance tracking: when a human finger touches the surface of an RFID tag, the impedance of the antenna changes. This change manifests as a change in the phase of the RFID backscattered signal, and is used by RIO to track fine-grained touch movement over both off-the shelf and custom built tags. We study this impedance behavior in-depth and show how RIO is a reliable UI primitive that is robust even within a multi-tag environment. We leverage this primitive to build a prototype of RIO that can continuously locate a finger during a swipe movement to within 3 mm of its actual position. We also show how custom-design RFID tags can be built and used with RIO, and provide two example applications that demonstrate its real-world use.},

abstract = {With parallel decoding for backscatter communication, tags are allowed to transmit concurrently and more efficiently. Existing parallel decoding mechanisms, however, assume that signals of the tags are highly stable, and hence may not perform optimally in the naturally dynamic backscatter systems. This paper introduces FlipTracer, a practical system that achieves highly reliable parallel decoding even in hostile channel conditions. FlipTracer is designed with a key insight: although the collided signal is time-varying and irregular, transitions between signals' combined states follow highly stable probabilities, which offers important clues for identifying the collided signals, and provides us with an opportunity to decode the collided signals without relying on stable signals. Motivated by this observation, we propose a graphical model, called one-flip-graph (OFG), to capture the transition pattern of collided signals, and design a reliable approach to construct the OFG in a manner robust to the diversity in backscatter systems. Then FlipTracer can resolve the collided signals by tracking the OFG. We have implemented FlipTracer and evaluated its performance with extensive experiments across a wide variety of scenarios. Our experimental results have shown that FlipTracer achieves a maximum aggregated throughput that approaches 2 Mbps, which is 6x higher than the state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Target imaging and material identification play an important role in many real-life applications. This paper introduces TagScan, a system that can identify the material type and image the horizontal cut of a target simultaneously with cheap commercial off the-shelf (COTS) RFID devices. The key intuition is that different materials and target sizes cause different amounts of phase and RSS (Received Signal Strength) changes when radio frequency (RF) signal penetrates through the target. Multiple challenges need to be addressed before we can turn the idea into a functional system including (i) indoor environments exhibit rich multipath which breaks the linear relationship between the phase change and the propagation distance inside a target; (ii) without knowing either material type or target size, trying to obtain these two information simultaneously is challenging; and (iii) stitching pieces of the propagation distances inside a target for an image estimate is non-trivial. We propose solutions to all the challenges and evaluate the system's performance in three different environments. TagScan is able to achieve higher than 94% material identification accuracies for 10 liquids and differentiate even very similar objects such as Coke and Pepsi. TagScan can accurately estimate the horizontal cut images of more than one target behind a wall.},

abstract = {Deployment of billions of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) RFID tags has drawn much of the attention of the research community because of the performance gaps of current systems. In particular, hash-enabled protocol (HEP) is one of the most thoroughly studied topics in the past decade. HEPs are designed for a wide spectrum of notable applications (e.g., missing detection) without need to collect all tags. HEPs assume that each tag contains a hash function, such that a tag can select a random but predicable time slot to reply with a one-bit presence signal that shows its existence. However, the hash function has never been implemented in COTS tags in reality, which makes HEPs a 10-year untouchable mirage. This work designs and implements a group of analog on-tag hash primitives (called Tash) for COTS Gen2-compatible RFID systems, which moves prior HEPs forward from theory to practice. In particular, we design three types of hash primitives, namely, tash function, tash table function and tash operator. All of these hash primitives are implemented through selective reading, which is a fundamental and mandatory functionality specified in Gen2 protocol, without any hardware modification and fabrication. We further apply our hash primitives in two typical HEP applications (i.e., cardinality estimation and missing detection) to show the feasibility and effectiveness of Tash. Results from our prototype, which is composed of one ImpinJ reader and 3,000 Alien tags, demonstrate that the new design lowers 60% of the communication overhead in the air. The tash operator can additionally introduce an overhead drop of 29.7%.},

The goal of this work is to investigate a trustworthy, continuous, and non-contact user authentication approach based on a heart-related biometric that works in a daily-life environment. To this end, we present a novel, continuous authentication system, namely Cardiac Scan, based on geometric and non-volitional features of the cardiac motion. Cardiac motion is an automatic heart deformation caused by self-excitement of the cardiac muscle, which is unique to each user and is difficult (if not impossible) to counterfeit. Cardiac Scan features intrinsic liveness detection, unobtrusiveness, cost-effectiveness, and high usability. We prototype a remote, high-resolution cardiac motion sensing system based on the smart DC-coupled continuous-wave radar. Fiducial-based invariant identity descriptors of cardiac motion are extracted after the radar signal demodulation. We conduct a pilot study with 78 subjects to evaluate Cardiac Scan in accuracy, authentication time, permanence, evaluation in complex conditions, and vulnerability. Specifically, Cardiac Scan achieves 98.61% balanced accuracy (BAC) and 4.42% equal error rate (EER) in a real-world setup. We demonstrate that Cardiac Scan is a robust and usable continuous authentication system.},

abstract = {Voice has become an increasingly popular User Interaction (UI) channel, mainly contributing to the current trend of wearables, smart vehicles, and home automation systems. Voice assistants such as Alexa, Siri, and Google Now, have become our everyday fixtures, especially when/where touch interfaces are inconvenient or even dangerous to use, such as driving or exercising. The open nature of the voice channel makes voice assistants difficult to secure, and hence exposed to various threats as demonstrated by security researchers. To defend against these threats, we present VAuth, the first system that provides continuous authentication for voice assistants. VAuth is designed to fit in widely-adopted wearable devices, such as eyeglasses, earphones/buds and necklaces, where it collects the body-surface vibrations of the user and matches it with the speech signal received by the voice assistant's microphone. VAuth guarantees the voice assistant to execute only the commands that originate from the voice of the owner. We have evaluated VAuth with 18 users and 30 voice commands and find it to achieve 97% detection accuracy and less than 0.1% false positive rate, regardless of VAuth's position on the body and the user's language, accent or mobility. VAuth successfully thwarts various practical attacks, such as replay attacks, mangled voice attacks, or impersonation attacks. It also incurs low energy and latency overheads and is compatible with most voice assistants.},

abstract = {Today's mobile devices contain sensitive data, which raises concerns about data security. This paper discusses a covert channel threat on existing mobile systems. Through it, malware can wirelessly leak information without making network connections or emitting signals, such as sound, EMR, vibration, etc., that we can feel or are aware of. The covert channel is built on a communication method that we call NICScatter. NICScatter transmitter malware forces mobile devices, such as mobile phones, tablets or laptops, to reflect surrounding RF signals to covertly convey information. The operation is achieved by controlling the impedance of a device's wireless network interface card (NIC). Importantly, the operation requires no special privileges on current mobile OSs, which allows the malware to stealthily pass sensitive data to an attacker's nearby mobile device, which can then decode the signal and thus effectively gather the guarded data. Our experiments with different mobile devices show that the covert channel can achieve 1.6 bps and transmit as far as 2 meters. In a through-the-wall scenario, it can transmit up to 70 cm.},

abstract = {Wearable devices such as smartwatches offer exciting new opportunities for users to interact with their applications. However, the current wearable programming model requires the developer to write a custom companion app for each wearable form factor; the companion app extends the smartphone display onto the wearable, relays user interactions from the wearable to the phone, and updates the wearable display as needed. The development effort required to write a companion app is significant and will not scale to an increasing diversity of form factors. This paper argues for a different programming model for wearable devices. The developer writes an application for the smartphone, but only specifies a UI design for the wearable. Our UIWear system abstracts a logical model of the smartphone GUI, re-tailors the GUI for the wearable device based on the specified UI design, and compiles it into a companion app that we call the UICompanion app. We implemented UIWear on Android smartphones, AndroidWear smartwatches, and Sony SmartEyeGlasses. We evaluate 20 developer-written companion apps from the AndroidWear category on Google Play against the UIWear-created UICompanion apps. The lines-of-code required for the developer to specify the UI design in UIWear is an order-of-magnitude smaller compared to the companion app lines-of-code. Further, in most cases, the UICompanion app performed comparably or better than the corresponding companion app both in terms of qualitative metrics, including latency and energy, and quantitative metrics, including look-and-feel.},

abstract = {Rapid development is essential for IoT (Internet of Things) application developers to obtain first-mover advantages and reduce the development cost. In this paper, we present TinyLink, a holistic system for rapid development of IoT applications. The key idea of TinyLink is to use a top-down approach for designing both the hardware and the software of IoT applications. Developers write the application code in a C-like language to specify the key logic of their applications, without dealing with the details of the specific hardware components. Taking the application code as input, TinyLink automatically generates the hardware configuration as well as the binary program executable on the target hardware platform. TinyLink provides unified APIs for applications to interact with the underlying hardware components. We implement TinyLink and evaluate its performance using real-world IoT applications. Results show that: (1) TinyLink achieves rapid development of IoT applications, reducing 52.58% of lines of code in average compared with traditional approaches; (2) TinyLink searches a much larger design space and thus can generate a superior solution for the hardware configuration, compared with the state-of-the-art approach; (3) TinyLink incurs acceptable overhead in terms of execution time and program memory.},

Our design allows a user to install data management solutions as apps, install multiple such solutions on a single device, and choose a suitable solution each for one or more apps. It allows app developers to focus their effort on app logic and helps the developers of data management solutions to achieve wider deployability. It also gives increased control of data management to end users and allows them to use different solutions for different apps. We present a prototype implementation of our design called BlueMountain, and implement several data management solutions for file and database management to demonstrate the utility and ease of using our design. We perform detailed microbenchmarks as well as end-to-end measurements for files and databases to demonstrate the performance overhead incurred by our implementation.},

abstract = {In this paper, we perform a systematic design study of the "elephant in the room" facing the VR industry -- is it feasible to enable high-quality VR apps on untethered mobile devices such as smartphones? Our quantitative, performance-driven design study makes two contributions. First, we show that the QoE achievable for high-quality VR applications on today's mobile hardware and wireless networks via local rendering or offloading is about 10X away from the acceptable QoE, yet waiting for future mobile hardware or next-generation wireless networks (e.g. 5G) is unlikely to help, because of power limitation and the higher CPU utilization needed for processing packets under higher data rate. Second, we present Furion, a VR framework that enables high-quality, immersive mobile VR on today's mobile devices and wireless networks. Furion exploits a key insight about the VR workload that foreground interactions and background environment have contrasting predictability and rendering workload, and employs a split renderer architecture running on both the phone and the server. Supplemented with video compression, use of panoramic frames, and parallel decoding on multiple cores on the phone, we demonstrate Furion can support high-quality VR apps on today's smartphones over WiFi, with under 14ms latency and 60 FPS (the phone display refresh rate).},

However, a mobile GPU constitutes a major portion of power consumption on the devices, and mobile games top as the most popular class of graphics applications. This paper presents the design and implementation of RAVEN, a novel, on-the-fly frame rate scaling system for mobile gaming applications. RAVEN utilizes human visual perception of graphics change to opportunistically achieve power saving without degrading user experiences. The system develops a light-weight frame comparison technique to measure and predict perception-aware frame similarity. It also builds a low resolution virtual display which clones the device screen for performing similarity measurement at a low-power cost. It is able to work on an existing commercial smartphone and support applications from app stores without any modifications. It has been implemented on Nexus 5X, and its performance has been measured with 13 games. The system effectively reduces the overall power consumption of mobile devices while maintaining satisfactory user experiences. The power consumption is reduced by 21.78% on aver-age and up to 34.74%.},

abstract = {The most important step in an empirical computer scientist's research is gathering sufficient real-world data to validate a system. Unfortunately, it is also one of the most time-consuming and expensive tasks: placing measurement tools in remote networks or end-clients requires one to marshal resources from different administrative domains, devices, populations, and countries. Often such efforts culminate in a trace that is deficient in multiple ways: a small set of test subjects, a short time frame, missing ground truth for device IDs, networking environments lacking in diversity and geographic spread, or highly biased sampling. We present a method of addressing these challenges by leveraging the most open and globally accessible test and measurement platform: digital advertising. Digital advertising instantly provides a window into 7 billion devices spanning every county for an extremely low cost. We propose Advertising as a Platform (AaaP), an ad-based system to perform massive-scale mobile measurement studies. In contrast with measurements made by large media companies who own platforms, ad networks, and apps, we concentrate on the opportunities and challenges for researchers that are end-users of advertising systems. We evaluate a prototype system, discuss ethical guidelines, and demonstrate its use in four scenarios: IP2Geo databases, bandwidth measurement, energy management, and the identifiability of mobile users. We show the efficacy and ease-of-use of AaaP, and illuminate key challenges and the great promise of using AaaP to study a wide variety of mobile phenomena.},

abstract = {Despite much recent progress, Web page latencies over cellular networks remain much higher than those over wired networks. Proxies that execute Web page JavaScript (JS) and push objects needed by the client can reduce latency. However, a key concern is the scalability of the proxy which must execute JS for many concurrent users. In this paper, we propose to scale the proxies, focusing on a design where the proxy's execution is solely to push the needed objects and the client completely executes the page as normal. Such redundant execution is a simple, yet effective approach to cutting network latencies, which dominate page load delays in cellular settings. We develop whittling, a technique to identify and execute in the proxy only the JS code necessary to identify and push the objects required for the client page load, while skipping other code. Whittling is closely related to program slicing, but with the important distinction that it is acceptable to approximate the program slice in the proxy given the client's complete execution. Experiments with top Alexa Web pages show NutShell can sustain, on average, 27% more user requests per second than a proxy performing fully redundant execution, while preserving, and sometimes enhancing, the latency benefits.},

In this demo, we propose the first SmartWatch-based American sign language (ASL) recognition system, which is more comfortable, portable and user-friendly and offers accessibility anytime, anywhere. This system is based on the intuitive idea that each sign has its specific motion pattern which can be transformed into unique gyroscope and accelerometer signals and then analyzed and learned by using Long-Short term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) trained with connectionist temporal classification (CTC). In this way, signs and context information can be correctly recognized based on an off-the-shelf device (eg. SmartWatch, Smartphone). The experiments show that, in the Known user split task, our system reaches an average word error rate of 7.29% to recognize 73 sentences formed by 103 ASL signs and achieves detection ratio up to 93.7% for a single sign. The result also shows our system has a good adaptation, even including new users, it can achieve an average word error rate of 21.6% at the sentence level and reach an average detection ratio of 79.4%. Moreover, our system performs real time ASL translation, outputting the speech within 1.69 seconds for a sentence of 12 signs in average.},

abstract = {Although SDN is considered as one of the key technologies behind the impending 5G evolution of mobile networks, the opportunity of reaping its benefits is largely still untapped on the Radio Access Network (RAN) side due to the lack of a software-defined RAN (SD-RAN) platform. In this work we demonstrate the capabilities of FlexRAN, an open-source SD-RAN platform developed to fill this void. FlexRAN separates the RAN control and data planes with a custom-tailored southbound API. Besides it features a hierarchical control plane architecture that enables programmability, flexible and dynamic control function placement (allowing different degrees of coordination within and among base stations) and real-time control. Virtualized control functions and control delegation are two key features in FlexRAN that makes these capabilities possible. This demo illustrates the capabilities and the performance of FlexRAN based on a prototype implementation, while its applicability is highlighted through a Mobile Edge Computing use case, where it acts as an enabler of a video bitrate adaptation application based on the radio conditions at the network edge.},

Our demonstration of Orion's capabilities is based on a prototype implementation employing a modified version of the OpenAirInterface software LTE platform. Using this prototype, we demonstrate the functional and performance isolation, and the efficient sharing of radio hardware and spectrum that can be achieved among Orion RAN slices. Moreover, we show how Orion can be used in an end-to-end network slicing setting and demonstrate the effects of the slices' configuration and placement of virtual functions in the overall quality of the deployed services.},

We integrate the DEMS components into a holistic system and implement it on commodity mobile devices, where unmodified mobile applications can use DEMS to transmit data over multipath. We demonstrate the simple configuration of using DEMS over multipath, visualization of multipath scheduling, download time reduction of data chunks with DEMS over both emulated and real cellular/WiFi networks compared to default MinRTT scheduler, and application QoE improvement on mobile phones from DEMS.},

Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), initiated as an Industry Specification Group (ISG) within ETSI, is also emerging as a low-latency and high-throughput cloud environment at the edge of network. The noticeable success that aforementioned technologies made attracts massive research interests and the interplay between them on programmable network requires an open source platform to evaluate. In this work, we present a low-latency MEC platform (LL-MEC) providing the required flexibility and programmability to meet the expected performance gain following SDN and MEC principles. We also demonstrate an use case of real-time content caching application using LL-MEC platform and OpenAirInterface LTE implementation on commodity hardware.},

abstract = {Cross-Technology Communication is an emerging research direction providing a promising solution to the coexistence problem of heterogeneous wireless technologies in the ISM bands. However, existing works use only the coarse-grained packet-level information for cross-technology modulation, suffering from a low throughput (e.g., 10bps). Our approach, called BlueBee, aims at achieving much higher CTC throughput thus extends CTC applications. We pro- poses a new direction by emulating legitimate ZigBee frames using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio. Uniquely, BlueBee achieves dual-standard compliance (i.e., BLE and ZigBee) and transparency by selecting only the payload of Bluetooth frames, requiring neither hardware nor firmware changes at the BLE senders and ZigBee receivers. Our implementation on commodity device testbeds shows that BlueBee can achieve a more than 99% accuracy and a through- put 10,000x faster than the state-of-the-art CTC reported so far. In addition, we show a demo of using BlueBee on a smartphone to control several smart light bulbs a ached with ZigBee radio.},

To truly enable VR everywhere, we need position tracking to be available as a ubiquitous service. This paper demonstrates WiCapture, a novel approach which leverages commodity WiFi infrastructure, which is ubiquitous today, for tracking purposes. We prototyped WiCapture using off-the-shelf WiFi radios and demonstrated that it achieves an accuracy of 0.88 cm compared to sophisticated infrared-based tracking systems like the Oculus Rift, while providing much higher range, resistance to occlusion, ubiquity and ease of deployment.},

abstract = {The applicability of existing Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) methods, which rely on packet-level modulation, is severely limited due to their very low throughput, e.g., tens of bps. Our work, named as WEBee, opens a promising direction for high throughput CTC via physical-level emulation. Specifically, WEBee synthesizes the time-domain signals by choosing appropriate frequency-domain components fed into the subcarriers of WiFi OFDM. WE-Bee can emulate the desired physical-layer ZigBee signals by manipulating only the data bits in WiFi packet payload, requiring neither hardware nor firmware changes in commodity technologies. Moreover, WEBee enables the parallel CTC, where one WiFi frame emulates two ZigBee frames simultaneously. To evaluate the performance, we implemented WEBee on commodity devices (the Atheros AR2425 WiFi card, BCM 4330 WiFi card and CC2420, CC2530 ZigBee devices). Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that WEBee can achieve the CTC between WiFi and ZigBee with a reliable throughput of 126Kbps in noisy environment, 16,000x faster than current state-of-the-art CTC methods.},

In this demonstration, we will present MUST, an 802.11-compliant real-time system that provides seamless, high-speed connectivity over multi-band 60 GHz and WiFi devices. MUST has two key design components: (1) a WiFi-assisted 60 GHz link adaptation algorithm, which can instantaneously predict the best beam and PHY rate setting, with zero probing overhead at 60 GHz; and (2) a proactive blockage detection and switching algorithm which can re-direct ongoing user traffic to the robust interface within sub-10 ms latency. We have implemented MUST on off-the-shelf devices where our experiments show high throughput gain and almost 2 orders of magnitude cross-band switching latency improvement over state-of-the-art solutions.},

In this demo, we demonstrate that another powerful solution for extending physical layer flexibility in OFDM-based technologies is the dynamic adaptation of the channel width. Although some standards already define the possibility of utilizing multiple channel widths (e.g. 20MHz, 10MHz, 5MHz for IEEE 802.11a standards), such an utilization is limited to a static configuration of a value defined during the network set-up. Conversely, we demonstrate that channel width adaptations can be performed in real-time during network operation, even on a per-packet basis. To this purpose, we propose an innovative and efficient receiver design, which allows the transmitter to take decisions about the channel width without explicitly informing the receiver.},

abstract = {Wearable devices, such as smart watches, offer exciting new opportunities for users to interact with their applications. The current state of the art for wearable devices is for a developer to write a custom {em companion app}, which is a variant of the smartphone app, tailored to the wearable form factor. A developer puts a non-trivial amount of effort to write these companion apps and the programming model does not scale to an increasing diversity of form factors. In this demo, we show a working prototype of our system UIWear that allows a developer to easily extend a smartphone application to other wearable interfaces. Our system, UIWear, extracts the application GUI as a UI tree, which preserves the semantics of the GUI. The developer (or the user) only writes a {em metaprogram} to encode the GUI design for the wearable device; no effort is needed beyond the design phase. UIWear executes the metaprogram by performing all the underlying tasks to virtualize the application GUI, adapt it, and recreate it on the wearable. A metaprogram can create the same functionality as existing companion apps with an order-of-magnitude less programming effort.},

While such systems initially used reflected light as the communication media, direct light becomes the dominant media for the purpose of combating interference. Nonetheless, the data rate achievable by direct light LED-Camera VLC systems has hit its bottleneck: the dimension of the transmitters. In this demo, we revisit the reflected light approach and propose a novel modulation mechanism, ReflexCode, which converts the potentially destructive interferences into collaborative transmissions. Essentially, our ReflexCode system codes information by superposing light emissions from multiple transmitters. It combines traditional amplitude demodulation with slope detection to "decode" the grayscale modulated signal, and it tunes decoding thresholds dynamically depending on the spatial symbol distribution. In addition, ReflexCode re-engineers the balanced codes to avoid flicker from individual transmitters. We implement ReflexCode as a prototype and demonstrate that it can achieve a promising throughput.},

This feature can be used to support location-based information services (LBS) related for e.g. advertising local opportunities, temporary obstacles and traffic disturbances or emergency notifications. In this paper we introduce a demonstrator for Location-based Wi-Fi Services (LoWS) based on beacon stuffing.

abstract = {In this paper we present a graph-based resource allocation scheme for sidelink broadcast V2V communications. Harnessing available information on geographical position of vehicles and spectrum resources utilization, eNodeBs are capable of allotting the same set of sidelink resources to different vehicles distributed among several communications clusters. Within a communications cluster, it is crucial to prevent time-domain allocation conflicts since vehicles cannot transmit and receive simultaneously, i.e., they must transmit in orthogonal time resources. In this research, we present a solution based on a bipartite graph, where vehicles and spectrum resources are represented by vertices whereas the edges represent the achievable rate in each resource based on the SINR that each vehicle perceives. The aforementioned time orthogonality constraint can be approached by aggregating conflicting vertices into macro-vertices which, in addition, reduces the search complexity. We show mathematically and through simulations that the proposed approach yields an optimal solution. In addition, we provide simulations showing that the proposed method outperforms other competing approaches, specially in scenarios with high vehicular density.},

abstract = {The rapid growth in mobile connectivity is enabling phones to support a wide range of societally-important applications. In this work, we show that broad classes of popular mobile applications have distinct radio resource allocation signatures. Using this insight, we design a mobile application classifier, and demonstrate that (1) an application can infer its own type solely from its resource allocation patterns, and (2) anyone can accurately infer the type of application being served by each session on a particular cell tower. We present our findings by showing the breakdown of applications being served by an LTE base station belonging to a Tier 1 US provider in downtown Palo Alto. Our work encourages an open discussion about LTE standards, and whether they might need to be enhanced to mask features that can be exploited to infer application type from signals broadcast over the air.},

abstract = {Mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSN) are widely used for monitoring physical phenomena such as air pollution where the aim is usually to generate accurate pollution maps in real time. The generation of pollution maps can be performed using either sensor measurements or physical models which simulate the phenomenon of pollution dispersion. The combination of these two information sources, known as data assimilation, makes it possible to better monitor air pollution by correcting the simulations of physical models while relying on sensor measurements. The quality of data assimilation mainly depends on the number of measurements and their locations. A careful deployment of nodes is therefore necessary in order to get better pollution maps. In this ongoing work, we tackle the placement problem of pollution sensors and design a mixed integer programming model allowing to maximize the assimilation quality while ensuring the connectivity of the network. We perform some simulations on a dataset of the Lyon city, France in order to show the effectiveness of our model regarding the quality of pollution coverage.},

abstract = {Traffic flow prediction is an important research issue to avoid traffic congestion in transportation systems. Traffic congestion avoiding can be achieved by knowing traffic flow and then conducting transportation planning. Achieving traffic flow prediction is challenging as the prediction is affected by many complex factors such as inter-region traffic, vehicles' relations, and sudden events. However, as the mobile data of vehicles has been widely collected by sensor-embedded devices in transportation systems, it is possible to predict the traffic flow by analysing mobile data. This study proposes a deep learning based prediction algorithm, DeepTFP, to collectively predict the traffic flow on each and every traffic road of a city. This algorithm uses three deep residual neural networks to model temporal closeness, period, and trend properties of traffic flow. Each residual neural network consists of a branch of residual convolutional units. DeepTFP aggregates the outputs of the three residual neural networks to optimize the parameters of a time series prediction model. Contrast experiments on mobile time series data from the transportation system of England demonstrate that the proposed DeepTFP outperforms the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture based method in prediction accuracy.},

abstract = {Driver assistance systems, that rely on vehicular sensors such as cameras, LIDAR and other on-board diagnostic sensors, have progressed rapidly in recent years to increase road safety. Road conditions in developing countries like India are chaotic where roads are not well maintained and thus vehicular sensors alone do not suffice in detecting impending collisions. In this paper, we investigate a collaborative driver assistance system "DRIZY: DRIve eaSY" for such scenarios where inference is drawn from on-board camera feed to alert drivers of obstacles ahead and the cloud uses GPS sensor data uploaded by all vehicles to alert drivers of vehicles in potential collision trajectory. Thus, we combine computer vision and vehicle-to-cloud communication to create comprehensive situational awareness. We prototype our system to consider two types of collisions: vehicle-to-vehicle collisions based on uploading GPS sensor data of vehicles to cloud and vehicle-to-pedestrian collisions based on detecting pedestrians from vehicle's dashboard camera feed. Sensor data processing in each vehicle occurs on smartphone for GPS values which are then uploaded to cloud and on raspberry pi3 for video feeds to make a cost-effective solution. Experiments over both 4G and wireless networks in India show that collaborative driver assistance is feasible in low traffic density within acceptable driver reaction time of &lt;5 sec, but can be limited by the time to process compute-intensive video feeds in real-time. We investigate novel ways to optimize the processing to find an acceptable trade-off.},

We propose the Emotion-Aware Smart Tips (EAST), a novel approach that could help to inform users about their irregular emotional states with smart tips to improve their sleep qualities. EAST aims at helping users keep healthy sleep schedules and emotional states by providing smart tips through a novel model that combines multivariate regression, random forest, and neural network to quantify the relations between sleep patterns and emotional states.

We have designed a dual-layer traffic classification scheme based on fuzzy logic, where the classification model is trained remotely. The remotely trained model is then used by the edge gateway to classify the network traffic. We have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype and evaluate its performance in a real world environment. Theevaluation shows that IoTurva causes very small overhead while it works with minimal hardware, and that our model training and classification approach can improve system efficiency and privacy.},

abstract = {One of the main goals of mobile edge computing is to support new generation latency-sensitive networked applications. To manage such demanding applications, a fine-grained control of end-to-end paths is imperative. End-to-end delay estimation and forecast techniques were essential traffic engineering tools even before the mobile edge computing paradigm pushed the cloud closer to the end user. In this paper, we model the path selection problem for edge traffic engineering using a risk minimization technique inspired by portfolio theory in economics, and we use machine learning to estimate the risk of a path. In particular, using real latency time series measurements, collected with and without the GENI testbed, we compare four short-horizon latency estimation techniques, commonly used by the finance community to estimate prices of volatile financial instruments. Our initial results suggest that a Bayesian Network approach may lead to good latency estimation performance and open a few research questions that we are currently exploring.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of cloud computing and mobile computing, it is commonplace for users to request cloud services from mobile devices. Mobile edge clouds (MECs) allow the users to access the cloud services seamlessly. Although cloudlets provide a promising technique to reduce the service access latency, how to place the data-intensive service in MECs to reduce the communication overhead between different services is yet to be addressed. To attack this challenge, this paper proposes an approach for mining interacting services and placing the services on the cloudlets by optimizing the communication overhead. In this approach, a frequent itemsets mining algorithm is proposed to obtain the fine-grained frequent 2-itemsets by analyzing the cookies. This algorithm determines the minimum support threshold automatically, based on which FP-tree with FP-matrix is constructed to avoid traversing the FP-tree during the process of frequent 2-itemsets discovery, then a searching algorithm is presented to mine the discriminative frequent 2-itemsets with interestingness measure. Furthermore, the communication overhead is optimized with the capacity constraints of cloudlets. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our approach by real-world data based simulations. The results show our approach can reduce the communication overhead for service placement in MECs.},

To support such experiments, we developed an approach to integrate a real system to test into a large scale simulation scenario without the need to change the physical and access layer parts of the communication stack of this system. We closely followed the Hardware In The Loop (HIL) simulation concept but also integrated a wireless communication channel into the picture.

Unlike existing service sharing systems (e.g., ridesharing), the delivery of food in FooDNet is more time-sensitive and the optimization problem is more complex regarding high-efficiency, huge-number of delivery needs. In particular, we study the food delivery problem in association with the Opportunistic Online Takeout Ordering &amp; Delivery service (O-OTOD). Specifically, the food is delivered incidentally by taxis when carrying passengers in the O-OTOD problem, and the optimization goal is to minimize the number of selected taxis to maintain a relative high incentive to the participated drivers. The two-stage method is proposed to solve the problem, consisting of the construction algorithm and the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithm. Preliminary experiments based on real-world taxi trajectory datasets verify that our proposed algorithms are effective and efficient.},

Besides, attackers often produce novel malware to bypass the conventional detection approaches, which are largely reliant on expert analysis to design the discriminative features manually. Therefore, more effective and easy-to-use approaches for detection of Android malware are in demand. In this paper, we design and implement EasyDefense, a lightweight defense system that is integrated with Android OS for easy and effective detection of Android malware utilizing machine learning methods and the ensemble of them. Besides universal static features such as permissions and API calls, EasyDefense also employs the N-gram features of operation codes (opcodes). These N-gram features are extracted and learnt automatically from raw data of applications. Experimental results on 204,650 applications show that users can easily and effectively protect the privacy and security on their smartphones through this system.},

We consider both uncoupled and different coupled congestion control algorithms, compare their performance and their potential to improve throughput over single path TCP, and uncover their limitations. In contrast to a recent study that reports reduced throughput with MPTCP compared to single path TCP over 60 GHz, our results show that significant performance improvements are possible, especially in the case of uncoupled congestion control. On the other hand, performance gains with coupled congestion control are lower as these algorithms often fail to fully utilize the capacity of both paths simultaneously. We also observe a pathological case that can lead to significantly reduced throughput with MPTCP regardless of the congestion control algorithm.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of vehicle ownership, parking has become an issue, especially in metropolitan areas -- the extra time for check-ins, check-outs and finding available parking spaces not only causes frustration and potential road rage on the driver side, but also increases the traffic congestion, gasoline waste and air pollution in consequence. In order to address these problems, the concept of "smart parking" is put forward. To make a parking lot "smart", we argue that three basic features, namely Vehicle Identification, Parking Space Detection and Indoor Localization are are critical and should be supported by the infrastructure. Herein, we present LightPark, a Visible Light Communication (VLC) solution to realize the vision of "smart parking". Building on top of the visible light backscatter communication primitive, LightPark is able to leverage the lighting infrastructure to perform scalable visible light communication and networking with the batter-free tag devices instrumented on the vehicles and parking spaces to manage the critical information such as identification and real-time location of vehicles, and status of parking spaces in a centralized and low-cost manner.},

abstract = {We present our efforts to design the first Visible Light Sensing (VLS) system that consumes only tens of μ Ws of power to sense and communicate. Our system requires no modification to the existing light infrastructure and uses unmodulated ambient light as sensing medium. We achieve this by designing a sensing mechanism that uses solar cells to achieve sub-μWs of power consumption. Further, we devise an ultra-low power backscatter based transmission mechanism we call Scatterlight that transmits digital readings without incurring the processing and computation overhead of existing sensors. Based on these principles we build a preliminary prototype. Our initial results demonstrate its ability to sense and communicate three hand gestures at 20 μWs of power.},

However, they require decorrelation techniques to resolve coherent multipath components. The conventional decorrelation techniques reduce the effective aperture of the MIMO array, thus reducing the resolution and number of resolved paths. In this paper, we introduce MIMO smoothing as a new technique to bring decorrelation effect by leveraging the spacial and frequential diversity in MIMO transmitters and receivers. Via extensive experiments on WiFi links, we show that MIMO smoothing can increase the accuracy of multipath resolution.},

abstract = {There have been increasing interests in exploring the sensing capabilities of RFID beyond its basic identification task, to reveal more information of tagged objects and the physical world. Phase is a crucial physical feature for many RFID sensing applications, such as tag localization. Most existing methods rely on a low multipath environment for accurate phase measurement. Unfortunately, practical environments are highly likely to be multipath-revalent, especially for indoors. This paper presents the first work to extract "clean" phase measurement of RFID tags in multipath-prevalent environments. We propose CPEX (Clean Phase EXtraction) based on theoretical modeling, which is also validated via experimental results of our prototype implementation. We studied the performance of CPEX on tag localization. CPEX can achieve median errors of 4.3-6.4cm (in different setups), which is the most accurate 3D tag localization result in multipath-prevalent environments.},

One of the major problems is that a legal drone may be illegally hijacked by GPS spoofing attacks. Though some GPS anti-spoofing techniques have been proposed, no effective technique has been implemented in commodity drones yet due to practical limitations. Motivated by the ubiquitous WiFi signals around us, we propose WiDrone, a WiFi fingerprint location cross-check based anti-hijacking system on commodity drones in this poster. WiDrone still relies on GPS for navigation but it will authenticate the destination by comparing current WiFi fingerprint (CWF) with the destination WiFi fingerprint (DWF) when the drone receives a landing order. Furthermore, we propose a WiFi fingerprint authentication algorithm to decide whether CWF matches DWF. We have designed and implemented the prototype of WiDrone on DJI Matrice 100 to ascertain the practicability of proposed system.},

By exploiting the prevalence of existing WiFi infrastructure in buildings, we developed a novel OpenWrt based firmware for COTS WiFi routers to collect the CSI measurements from regular data frames. To identify different human activities, an automatic kernel representation learning method, namely auto-HSRL, is established to selection informative Hilbert space patterns from time, frequency, wavelet, and shape domains. A new information fusion tool based on multi-view kernel learning is proposed to combine the representations extracted from diverse perspectives and build up a robust and comprehensive activity classifier. Extensive experiments were conducted in an office and the experimental results demonstrate that SmartSense outperforms existing methods and achieves a 98% activity recognition accuracy.},

abstract = {Cities have benefited from the three greatest technological innovations of the past 200 years: the steam engine, electrification, and the automobile. But each advance has created its own challenges, including pollution, overcrowding, sprawl. As the digital revolution transforms cities once again, how can we make sure it improves quality of life while minimizing the downside? With population density comes the possibility of deploying network connectivity and wayfinding at lower cost, but density also increases complexity of deployment. How can digital technology reduce the bad friction of urban environments, such as congestion, cost, and complexity, while increasing good friction, such as all of the serendipitous interactions that cities encourage? Underlying all this change is ubiquitous connectivity and mobile technology, from the phones people carry with them to the supporting devices and network endpoints embedded in the urban infrastructure. Sidewalk Labs is an Alphabet company that works with cities to develop new technology that can improve urban life. We will discuss some of our discoveries and beliefs, and talk about our plans to use mobile technology to help cities take full advantage of the digital revolution.},

abstract = {Visible Light Communication (VLC) emerges as a new wireless communication technology with appealing benefits not present in radio communication. However, current VLC designs commonly require LED lights to emit shining light beams, which greatly limits the applicable scenarios of VLC (e.g., in a sunny day when indoor lighting is not needed). It also entails high energy overhead and unpleasant visual experiences for mobile devices to transmit data using VLC. We design and develop DarkLight, a new VLC primitive that allows light-based communication to be sustained even when LEDs emit extremely-low luminance. The key idea is to encode data into ultra-short, imperceptible light pulses. We tackle challenges in circuit designs, data encoding/decoding schemes, and DarkLight networking, to efficiently generate and reliably detect ultra-short light pulses using off-the-shelf, low-cost LEDs and photodiodes. Our DarkLight prototype supports 1.3-m distance with 1.6-Kbps data rate. By loosening up VLC's reliance on visible light beams, DarkLight presents an unconventional direction of VLC design and fundamentally broadens VLC's application scenarios.},

abstract = {Traditional vibration inspection systems, equipped with separated sensing and communication modules, are either very expensive (e.g., hundreds of dollars) and/or suffer from occlusion and narrow field of view (e.g., laser). In this work, we present an RFID-based solution, Tagbeat, to inspect mechanical vibration using COTS RFID tags and readers. Making sense of micro and high-frequency vibration using random and low-frequency readings of tag has been a daunting task, especially challenging for achieving sub-millisecond period accuracy. Our system achieves these three goals by discerning the change pattern of backscatter signal replied from the tag, which is attached on the vibrating surface and displaced by the vibration within a small range. This work introduces three main innovations. First, it shows how one can utilize COTS RFID to sense mechanical vibration and accurately discover its period with a few periods of short and noisy samples. Second, a new digital microscope is designed to amplify the micro-vibration-induced weak signals. Third, Tagbeat introduces compressive reading to inspect high-frequency vibration with relatively low RFID read rate. We implement Tagbeat using a COTS RFID device and evaluate it with a commercial centrifugal machine. Empirical benchmarks with a prototype show that Tagbeat can inspect the vibration period with a mean accuracy of 0.36ms and a relative error rate of 0.03%. We also study three cases to demonstrate how to associate our inspection solution with the specific domain requirements.},

By leveraging masking effects of the human auditory system and readily available audio signals in our daily lives, Dolphin ensures real-time unobtrusive speaker-microphone data communication without affecting the primary audio-hearing experience for human users, while, at the same time, it overcomes the main limitations of existing screen-camera links. Our Dolphin prototype, built using off-the-shelf smartphones, realizes real-time hidden communication, supports up to 8-meter signal capture distance and ±90° listening angle and achieves decoding rate above 80% without error correction. Further, it achieves average data rates of up to 500bps while keeping the decoding rate above 95% within a distance of 1m.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a near-ultrasound chirp signal-based communication for the TV's 2nd screen services. While near-ultrasound (with under 20 kHz frequency) communication has been developed for various applications recently, none of the previous work provides a perfect solution for 2nd screen services between TVs and smart devices. This is due mainly to the following real world challenges. The embedded signal in TV contents should be successfully received in a typical TV-watching environment by (i) delivering information at least at 15 bps with significantly low volume to avoid human perception, (ii) despite the presence of ambient noise, e.g., a tick, a snap, or a knock. To fulfill (i), we design chirp quaternary orthogonal keying (QOK) symbols. Especially, we aim to minimize inter-symbol interference (ISI) effects by symbol design in order to completely eliminate guard intervals. To resolve (ii), we propose the novel J-shape detection algorithms for both frame synchronization and carrier sensing. The proposed modem achieves almost zero frame error rate on a smartphone 2.7 m away from the TV even with minimal receive sound pressure level of 35 dBSPL, i.e., the noise level in a very quiet room. Moreover, throughout experiments and log analysis of 2nd screen service deployed in a nation-wide TV broadcasting system, J-shape detection algorithms are proven to achieve highly resilient performance for both frame synchronization and carrier sensing compared to previous schemes.},

abstract = {3D orientation tracking is an essential ingredient for many Internet-of-Things applications. Yet existing orientation tracking systems commonly require motion sensors that are only available on battery-powered devices. In this paper, we propose Tagyro, which attaches an array of passive RFID tags as orientation sensors on everyday objects. Tagyro uses a closed-form model to transform the run-time phase offsets between tags into orientation angle. To enable orientation tracking in 3D space, we found the key challenge lies in the imperfect radiation pattern of practical tags, caused by the antenna polarity, non-isotropic emission and electromagnetic coupling, which substantially distort phase measurement. We address these challenges by designing a set of phase sampling and recovery algorithms, which together enable reliable orientation sensing with 3 degrees of freedom. We have implemented a real-time version of Tagyro on a commodity RFID system. Our experiments show that Tagyro can track the 3D orientation of passive objects with a small error of 4°, at a processing rate of 37.7 samples per second.},

This paper develops high-preCision Acoustic Tracker (CAT), which aims to replace a traditional mouse and let a user play games, interact with VR/AR headsets, and control smart appliances by moving a smartphone in the air. Achieving high tracking accuracy is essential to provide enjoyable user experience. To this end, we develop a novel system that uses audio signals to achieve mm-level tracking accuracy. It lets multiple speakers transmit inaudible sounds at different frequencies. Based on the received sound, our system continuously estimates the distance and velocity of the mobile with respect to the speakers to continuously track it. At its heart lies a distributed Frequency Modulated Continuous Waveform (FMCW) that can accurately estimate the absolute distance between a transmitter and a receiver that are separate and unsynchronized. We further develop an optimization framework to combine FMCW estimation with Doppler shifts and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements to enhance the accuracy, and efficiently solve the optimization problem. We implement two systems: one on a desktop and another on a mobile phone. Our evaluation and user study show that our system achieves high tracking accuracy and ease of use using existing hardware.},

We use speakers and microphones that already exist on most mobile devices to perform device-free tracking of a hand/finger. The key idea is to use acoustic phase to get fine-grained movement direction and movement distance measurements. LLAP first extracts the sound signal reflected by the moving hand/finger after removing the background sound signals that are relatively consistent over time. LLAP then measures the phase changes of the sound signals caused by hand/finger movements and then converts the phase changes into the distance of the movement. We implemented and evaluated LLAP using commercial-off-the-shelf mobile phones. For 1-D hand movement and 2-D drawing in the air, LLAP has a tracking accuracy of 3.5 mm and 4.6 mm, respectively. Using gesture traces tracked by LLAP, we can recognize the characters and short words drawn in the air with an accuracy of 92.3% and 91.2%, respectively.},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates a new technology that can infer a person's emotions from RF signals reflected off his body. EQ-Radio transmits an RF signal and analyzes its reflections off a person's body to recognize his emotional state (happy, sad, etc.). The key enabler underlying EQ-Radio is a new algorithm for extracting the individual heartbeats from the wireless signal at an accuracy comparable to on-body ECG monitors. The resulting beats are then used to compute emotion-dependent features which feed a machine-learning emotion classifier. We describe the design and implementation of EQ-Radio, and demonstrate through a user study that its emotion recognition accuracy is on par with state-of-the-art emotion recognition systems that require a person to be hooked to an ECG monitor.},

abstract = {Cellular operators want to be able to deploy small cells with the same ease as WiFi access points, to quickly address traffic hotspots in dense urban areas. However, deploying small cells has not been easy. The reason is that due to scarcity of licensed spectrum, small cells need to use the same spectrum as the existing macro cells, and they need to explicitly coordinate their spectrum usage with each other to manage interference. The challenge is that this coordination needs to happen with latencies less than a millisecond, otherwise adding small cells does not help scale the overall network capacity. Implementing such tight coordination in dense urban deployments has not been easy in practice.We present QuickC, a wireless transport technology that can simplify small cell deployment. QuickC enables small cells to coordinate with their neighboring macro and small cells with sub-1ms latencies over the operator's licensed spectrum but in a way that the users of this spectrum are negligibly affected. QuickC is designed to be an "add on" to existing cellular networks and does not require any invasive changes to the existing infrastructure or standards. We implement QuickC on a commodity system on chip from Texas Instruments used for building commercial cellular baseband and show that it can consistently deliver latencies less than 0.6 ms between neighboring cells. We also use system-level simulations to evaluate the wide-area impact of deploying QuickC in current networks, and show that it can deliver 5--10 Mbps of bandwidth between neighboring cells while causing less than 1--4% throughput degradation to the existing users of the spectrum.},

abstract = {Multi-User MIMO, the hallmark of IEEE 802.11ac and the upcoming 802.11ax, promises significant throughput gains by supporting multiple concurrent data streams to a group of users. However, identifying the best-throughput MU-MIMO groups in commodity 802.11ac networks poses three major challenges: a) Commodity 802.11ac users do not provide full CSI feedback, which has been widely used for MU-MIMO grouping. b) Heterogeneous channel bandwidth users limit grouping opportunities. c) Limited-resource on APs cannot support computationally and memory expensive operations, required by existing algorithms. Hence, state-of-the-art designs are either not portable in 802.11ac APs, or perform poorly, as shown by our testbed experiments. In this paper, we design and implement MUSE, a lightweight user grouping algorithm, which addresses the above challenges. Our experiments with commodity 802.11ac testbeds show MUSE can achieve high throughput gains over existing designs.},

Our experiments demonstrate that the large asymmetry in the channel access methodologies employed by WiFi and LTE (carrier sensing/notification in WiFi, energy sensing alone in LTE-U), can result LTE-U completely blocking WiFi transmissions, and causing significant degradation to either technologies from collisions.We address this critical sensing asymmetry with Ultron, a LTE-WiFi co-existence solution that integrates WiFi's carrier sensing and notification mechanisms into LTE, without any modifications to the LTE PHY standard. Ultron operates at the LTE base station and consists of two key components: (a) WiFi embedding that embeds appropriate data into the LTE-subframes through an intelligent reverse-engineering of the LTE PHY, so as to realize a WiFi PLCP preamble-header transmission over the air directly using the LTE PHY; and (b) scalable WiFi sensing that employs a single WiFi interface and maximizes its carrier sensing benefits to all the unlicensed channels operating at the LTE node. Our evaluations demonstrate that Ultron can increase the WiFi and LTE throughput by 5x and 6x respectively, resulting from a sharp reduction in LTE-WiFi interference.},

abstract = {To meet the growing demand for wireless data, it is time to move away from the age-old paradigm of prohibiting interfering nodes from transmissions. Instead, through proactive management of interference among multiple colliding packets, we can design high throughput wireless systems. This is well explored in the Information Theory community and there are also a few implementational efforts that have been recently reported. The existing solutions are nontrivial to use in real systems as they require either tight time/frequency synchronization or exchange of data between transmitters prior to the transmissions. These requirements are hard to meet in practice especially for uplink transmissions. This paper proposes BASIC, a lightweight multi-user uplink transmission strategy that does not require tight synchronization or exchange of samples among nodes, which makes it an attractive alternative compared to its counterparts. BASIC exploits receiver diversity by controlling the data rates of the clients. A novel greedy algorithm is proposed for data rate selection. We implement BASIC on a software-defined radio platform. Our experiments on a real testbed show that BASIC outperforms TDMA by 48% in terms of overall throughput. Our trace-driven simulations show up to 4.8x gain in throughput with similar flow fairness.},

OpenMili builds from off-the-shelf FPGA processor, data converters and 60 GHz RF front-end. It employs customized clocking, channelization and interfacing modules, to achieve Gsps sampling bandwidth, Gbps wireless bit-rate, and Gsps sample streaming from/to a PC host. It also incorporates the first programmable, electronically steerable 60 GHz phased-array antenna. OpenMili adopts programming models that ease development, through automatic parallelization inside signal processing blocks, and modular, rate-insensitive interfaces across blocks. It provides common reference designs to bootstrap the development of new network protocols and sensing applications. We verify the effectiveness of OpenMili through benchmark communication/sensing experiments, and showcase its usage by prototyping a pairwise phased-array localization scheme, and a learning-assisted real-time beam adaptation protocol.},

Do CPs that update their CDN contracts to allow IPv6 hosting achieve better, or worse performance in mobile networks? Should CDNs continue to host mobile content over IPv4 networks, or persuade to their CP customers the performance benefits of IPv6 content delivery?In this paper we answer these questions through a comprehensive comparison of IPv4 and IPv6 mobile Web performance in cellular networks in the US from the point of view of Akamai's content delivery infrastructure. Our data show that IPv6 hosting outperforms legacy IPv4 paths in mobile Web. Our analysis leads to clear recommendations for CPs to transition to IPv6-hosted mobile Web. Finally, we propose new mechanisms, through which CDNs can safely transition mobile content to IPv6-enabled servers for improved content delivery.},

In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study of multipath for mobile settings, focusing on MPTCP, with the goal of developing key insights for evolving the mobile multipath design. First, we conduct to our knowledge the most in-depth and the longest user trial of mobile multipath that focuses not only on MPTCP performance, but also on cross-layer interactions. Second, we identify a new research problem of multipath-aware CDN server selection. We demonstrate its real-world importance and provide recommendations. Third, our measurement findings lead us to design and implement a flexible software architecture for mobile multipath called MPFlex, which strategically employs multiplexing to improve multipath performance (by up to 63% for short-lived flows). MPFlex decouples the high-level scheduling algorithm and the low-level OS protocol implementation, and enables developers to flexibly plug-in new multipath features. MPFlex also provides an ideal vantage point for flexibly realizing user-specified multipath policies and is friendly to middleboxes.},

abstract = {We propose and demonstrate accurate 3D real-time indoor localization via broadband nonlinear backscatter in passive devices. The proposed method does not need any relative motion between a reader and a tag or the use of reference anchor nodes. In the conventional radio frequency identification (RFID) system, a passive tag responds to a reader by switching its antenna "on" and "off". The operation of such conventional backscatter is essentially "linear", since the reader-to-tag (downlink) and tag-to-reader (uplink) signals overlap on the same carrier frequency. Although linear backscatter is straightforward, the self-jamming problem caused by strong leakage signals from the transmitter to the receiver is notorious and poses many constraints on the received signal quality, operation bandwidth, modulation flexibility and system complexity. To enable high-accuracy real-time 3D indoor localization for passive devices, we show that nonlinear backscatter is more effective than linear backscatter. Nonlinear backscatter exploits nonlinear elements in passive devices to generate second or higher-order harmonics as the uplink response. Separation of downlink and uplink on different carriers allows immediate self-jamming cancellation and direct un-modulated carrier phase decoding, hence resulting in better received signal quality and broad bandwidth of operation, both of which are critical for the localization system. The broad bandwidth allows the design of an efficient phase-based ranging algorithm - heuristic multi-frequency continuous wave (HMFCW) ranging which resolves ambiguous phase cycles with heuristically optimized sparse carrier frequencies. HMFCW ranging can correctly pin down the phase cycle integer with 100% reliability as long as the phase error falls within ±90° \texttimes{} BW% (percentage bandwidth). In our present implementation, we achieved a median ranging error below 1 cm under phase error bounds of ±50°. We realized real-time 3D localization from differential ranging by nonlinear conjugate gradient (CG) search for hyperboloids intersection in a multi-static transceiving system with 1 Tx antenna and 4 Rx antennas. The measured 3D localization median error was 3.5 cm in the indoor environment. Presently, the measurement latency was less than 0.155 seconds. We will present system design, algorithms and a prototype with experimental evaluation.},

LiTell builds on the key observation that each FL has an inherent characteristic frequency which can serve as a discriminative feature. It incorporates a set of sampling, signal amplification and camera optimization mechanisms, that enable a smartphone to capture the extremely weak and high frequency ( &gt; 80 kHz) features. We have implemented LiTell as a real-time localization and navigation system on Android. Our experiments demonstrate LiTell's high reliability in discriminating different FLs, and its potential to achieve sub-meter location granularity. Our user study in a multi-storey office building, parking lot and grocery store further validates LiTell as an accurate, robust and ready-to-use indoor localization system.},

abstract = {Device-free localization of people and objects indoors not equipped with radios is playing a critical role in many emerging applications. This paper presents an accurate model-based device-free localization system LiFS, implemented on cheap commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi devices. Unlike previous COTS device-based work, LiFS is able to localize a target accurately without offline training. The basic idea is simple: channel state information (CSI) is sensitive to a target's location and by modelling the CSI measurements of multiple wireless links as a set of power fading based equations, the target location can be determined. However, due to rich multipath propagation indoors, the received signal strength (RSS) or even the fine-grained CSI can not be easily modelled. We observe that even in a rich multipath environment, not all subcarriers are affected equally by multipath reflections. Our pre-processing scheme tries to identify the subcarriers not affected by multipath. Thus, CSIs on the "clean" subcarriers can be utilized for accurate localization.We design, implement and evaluate LiFS with extensive experiments in three different environments. Without knowing the majority transceivers' locations, LiFS achieves a median accuracy of 0.5 m and 1.1 m in line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art systems. Besides single target localization, LiFS is able to differentiate two sparsely-located targets and localize each of them at a high accuracy.},

However, even the best inertial measurement units (IMU) are prone to various types of correlated failures.

The core challenge is in accurately computing the relative locations between each receiver pair, and translating these measurements into the drone's 3D orientation. Achieving IMU-like orientation requires the relative GPS distances to be accurate to a few centimeters -- a difficult task given that GPS today is only accurate to around 1-4 meters. Moreover, GPS-based orientation needs to be precise even under sharp drone maneuvers, GPS signal blockage, and sudden bouts of missing data. This paper designs SafetyNet, an off-the-shelf GPS-only system that addresses these challenges through a series of techniques, culminating in a novel particle filter framework running over multi-GNSS systems (GPS, GLONASS, and SBAS). Results from 11 sessions of 5-7 minute flights report median orientation accuracies of 2° even under overcast weather conditions. Of course, these improvements arise from an increase in cost due to the multiple GPS receivers, however, when safety is of interest, we believe that tradeoff is worthwhile.},

abstract = {This paper presents DopEnc, an acoustic-based encounter profiling system on smartphones. DopEnc can automatically identify the persons that users interact with in the context of encountering. DopEnc performs encounter profiling in two major steps: (1) Doppler profiling to detect that two persons approach and stop in front of each other via an effective trajectory, and (2) voice profiling to confirm that they are thereafter engaged in an interactive conversation. DopEnc is further extended to support parallel acoustic exploration of many users by incorporating a unique multiple access scheme within the limited inaudible acoustic frequency band. All implementation of DopEnc is based on commodity sensors like speakers, microphones and accelerometers integrated on commercial-off-the-shelf smartphones. We evaluate DopEnc with detailed experiments and a real use-case study of 11 participants. Overall DopEnc achieves an accuracy of 6.9% false positive and 9.7% false negative in real usage.},

abstract = {Video streaming is a prevalent mobile service that drains a significant amount of battery power. While various efforts have been made toward saving both video transfer and display energy, they are independently designed in an ad-hoc way and thereby can cause some non-apparent yet critical performance issues. To fill in this gap, this paper presents a fundamentally new design by jointly considering the end-to-end pipeline from the initial video encoding to the final mobile display. In essence, we shift the classic R-D tradeoff that has governed streaming system designs for decades to a fresh rate-distortion-energy (R-D-E) tradeoff specifically tailored for mobile devices. We present RnB, a video bitrate and display brightness adaptation platform that is standard-compliant, backward compatible, and device-neutral in order to achieve the proposed R-D-E tradeoff. RnB is empowered by some new discovery about the inherent relationship among bitrate, display brightness, and video quality as well as by an control-theoretic formulation to dynamically adapt the bitrate and scale the display brightness. Experimental results based on real-time implementation show that RnB can achieve an average of 19% energy reduction with final video quality comparable to conventional R-D based schemes.},

abstract = {Mobile apps that use sensors to monitor user behavior often employ resource heavy inference algorithms that make computational offloading a common practice. However, existing schedulers/offloaders typically emphasize one primary offloading aspect without fully exploring complementary goals (e.g., heterogeneous resource management with only partial visibility into underlying algorithms, or concurrent sensor app execution on a single resource) and as a result, may overlook performance benefits pertinent to sensor processing.We bring together key ideas scattered in existing offloading solutions to build LEO -- a scheduler designed to maximize the performance for the unique workload of continuous and intermittent mobile sensor apps without changing their inference accuracy. LEO makes use of domain specific signal processing knowledge to smartly distribute the sensor processing tasks across the broader range of heterogeneous computational resources of high-end phones (CPU, co-processor, GPU and the cloud). To exploit short-lived, but substantial optimization opportunities, and remain responsive to the needs of near real-time apps such as voice-based natural user interfaces, LEO runs as a service on a low-power co-processor unit (LPU) to perform both frequent and joint schedule optimization for concurrent pipelines. Depending on the workload and network conditions, LEO is between 1.6 and 3 times more energy efficient than conventional cloud offloading with CPU-bound sensor sampling. In addition, even if a general-purpose scheduler is optimized directly to leverage an LPU, we find LEO still uses only a fraction (&lt; 1/7) of the energy overhead for scheduling and is up to 19% more energy efficient for medium to heavy workloads.},

Typically, these applications need predefined features and are only applicable to predefined activities. In this work, we address the issue of deep understanding of arbitrary activities and semantic searching of any activity over massive mobile sensing data. The challenges stem from the rich dynamics and the wide-spectrum of activities that a human being could perform. We propose a hierarchical activity representation, extract common bases of motion data in an unsupervised manner by leveraging the power of deep neural networks, and propose a universal multi-resolution representation for all activities without prior knowledge. Based on this representation, we design an innovative system Lasagna to manage and search motion data semantically. We implement a prototype system and our comprehensive evaluations show that our system can achieve highly accurate activity classification (with precision 98.9%) and search (with recall almost 100% and precision about 90%) over a diverse set of activities.},

abstract = {Global Positioning System (GPS) is used ubiquitously in a wide variety of applications ranging from navigation and tracking to modern smart grids and communication networks. However, it has been demonstrated that modern GPS receivers are vulnerable to signal spoofing attacks. For example, today it is possible to change the course of a ship or force a drone to land in a hostile area by simply spoofing GPS signals. Several countermeasures have been proposed in the past to detect GPS spoofing attacks. These counter-measures offer protection only against naive attackers. They are incapable of detecting strong attackers such as those capable of seamlessly taking over a GPS receiver, which is currently receiving legitimate satellite signals, and spoofing them to an arbitrary location. Also, there is no hardware platform that can be used to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of existing countermeasures in real-world scenarios.In this work, we present SPREE, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first GPS receiver capable of detecting all spoofing attacks described in the literature. Our novel spoofing detection technique called auxiliary peak tracking enables detection of even a strong attacker capable of executing the seamless takeover attack. We implement and evaluate our receiver against three different sets of GPS signal traces: (i) a public repository of spoofing traces, (ii) signals collected through our own wardriving effort and (iii) using commercial GPS signal generators. Our evaluations show that SPREE constraints even a strong attacker (capable of seamless takeover attack) from spoofing the receiver to a location not more than 1 km away from its true location. This is a significant improvement over modern GPS receivers that can be spoofed to any arbitrary location. Finally, we release our implementation and datasets to the community for further research and development.},

These systems send contents of currently displayed app pages to the cloud to identify relevant entities (e.g., a movie) appearing in the current page and show information related to such entities (e.g., local theaters playing the movie). These new experiences come with privacy concerns as they can send sensitive on-screen data (bank details, medical data, etc.) to the cloud. We propose a novel approach that efficiently extracts app content semantics on the device, without exfiltrating user data. Our solution consists of two phases: an offline, user-agnostic, in-cloud phase that automatically annotates apps' UI elements with stable semantics, and a lightweight on-device phase that assigns semantics to captured app contents on the fly, by matching the annotations. With this automatic approach we annotated 100+ food, dining, and music apps, with accuracy over 80%. Our system implementation for Android and Windows Phone---Appstract---incurs minimal runtime overhead. We built eight use cases on the Appstract framework.},

abstract = {Multilateration techniques have been proposed to verify the integrity of unprotected location claims in wireless localization systems. A common assumption is that the adversary is equipped with only a single device from which it transmits location spoofing signals. In this paper, we consider a more advanced model where the attacker is equipped with multiple devices and performs a geographically distributed coordinated attack on the multilateration system. The feasibility of a distributed multi-device attack is demonstrated experimentally with a self-developed attack implementation based on multiple COTS software-defined radio (SDR) devices. We launch an attack against the OpenSky Network, an air traffic surveillance system that implements a time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) multi-lateration method for aircraft localization based on ADS-B signals. Our experiments show that the timing errors for distributed spoofed signals are indistinguishable from the multilateration errors of legitimate aircraft signals, indicating that the threat of multi-device spoofing attacks is real in this and other similar systems. In the second part of this work, we investigate physical-layer features that could be used to detect multi-device attacks. We show that the frequency offset and transient phase noise of the attacker's radio devices can be exploited to discriminate between a received signal that has been transmitted by a single (legitimate) transponder or by multiple (malicious) spoofing sources. Based on that, we devise a multi-device spoofing detection system that achieves zero false positives and a false negative rate below 1%.},

abstract = {The Location Service (LCS) proposed by the telecommunication industry is an architecture that allows the location of mobile devices to be accessed in various applications. We explore the use of LCS in location-enhanced server authentication, which traditionally relies on certificates. Given recent incidents involving certificate authorities, various techniques to strengthen server authentication were proposed. They focus on improving the certificate validation process, such as pinning, revocation, or multi-path probing. In this paper, we propose using the server's geographic location as a second factor of its authenticity. Our solution, SALVE, achieves location-based server authentication by using secure DNS resolution and by leveraging LCS for location measurements. We develop a TLS extension that enables the client to verify the server's location in addition to its certificate. Successful server authentication therefore requires a valid certificate and the server's presence at a legitimate geographic location, e.g., on the premises of a data center. SALVE prevents server impersonation by remote adversaries with mis-issued certificates or stolen private keys of the legitimate server. We develop a prototype implementation and our evaluation in real-world settings shows that it incurs minimal impact to the average server throughput. Our solution is backward compatible and can be integrated with existing approaches for improving server authentication in TLS.},

In the passive sensing, the received vibration signals are determined by the location of the touch impact. This allows location discrimination of touches precise enough to enable emerging applications such as virtual keyboards on ubiquitous surfaces for mobile devices. Moreover, in the active mode, the received vibration signals carry richer information of the touching object's characteristics (e.g., weight, size, location and material). This further enables our work to match the signals to the trained profiles and allows it to differentiate personal objects in contact with any surface. We evaluated extensively in the use cases of localizing touches (i.e., virtual keyboards), object localization and identification. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed vibration-based solution can achieve high accuracy, over 95%, in all these use cases.},

abstract = {Due to the popularity of soccer and the purposeful use of the head during play, traumatic brain injury to soccer players has been a concern for decades. However, there is a sense of urgency now in understanding and preventing concussions better, due to raising public awareness. Towards that end, intra-oral devices such as Vector MouthGuards are being studied [3] to measure the athlete's head's linear and rotational accelerations from impacts experienced in practices and games. But given the players' natural distaste for such intra-oral devices, more palatable alternatives for head impact monitoring are being developed [2]. X2 Biosystems xPatchis an electronic skin patch thatis worn behind the ear. Reebok Checklight embeds the impact sensor in the back of a skullcap which can be worn with or without a helmet. Triax SIM-P is placed inside a headband for non-helmeted sports and a skullcap for helmeted sports. While all these devices are much more convenient to wear than intra-oral devices, it is yet to be seen whether they gain wider acceptance, particularly by the millions of amateur soccer players all over the world.},

abstract = {Location-based services today, exceedingly depend on user mobility prediction, in order to push context aware services ahead of time. Existing location forecasting techniques are driven by large volumes of data to train the prediction models in a centralised server. This amounts to considerably long waiting times before the model kicks in. Disclosing highly sensitive location information to third party entities also exposes the user to several privacy risks. To address these issues, we put forth a mobility prediction system, able to provide swift realtime predictions, evading the strenuous training procedure. We enable this by constantly adapting the model to substantive user mobility behaviours that facilitate accurate predictions even on marginal time bounded movements. In comparison to existing frameworks, we utilise less volumes of data to produce satisfactory prediction accuracies. This in turn lowers the computational complexity making implementation on mobile devices feasible and a step towards privacy preservation. Here, only the predicted location can be sent to such services to maintain the utility/privacy tradeoff. Our preliminary evaluations based on real world mobility traces corroborate our hypothesis.},

We built a preliminary version that can collect and analyze sensor data in real time on the Android platform. To test the system, we recruited five healthy volunteers and measured six kinds of joint motions. The same tools used by physical therapists, measurements gathered from a goniometer and an inclinometer is what we used as the ground truth data for calibrations and evaluation of our algorithm. In the initial version, GonioSense estimation errors are within ± 5% for more than 80% cases.

abstract = {Usage of WiFi is becoming increasingly popular in public wireless LAN (WLAN) settings like malls, airports and train stations. Similarly to other prominent examples of WiFi usage like enterprise and home settings, public WLANs could also benefit from an SDN-based coordinated management framework that deals with issues like interference and mobility management. However, unlike these settings, public WLANs present a few differences in their characteristics, such as the need to offer location-aware services and dynamic categorization of users, and the consequent need to provide sophisticated association strategies. Motivated by this we propose VALI, an SDN management framework tailored to meet the needs of public WLAN settings. We give an overview of VALI and present initial results obtained using our prototype implementation deployed over a testbed that resembles a realistic public WLAN environment. Our results demonstrate that VALI is a promising solution that could be used to effectively manage public WLAN settings and enable location-aware WiFi access.},

abstract = {The resource usage model for millimeter wave bands has been the subject of considerable debate. The massive bandwidth, highly directional antennas, high penetration loss and susceptibility to shadowing in these bands suggest certain advantages to spectrum and infrastructure sharing. In particular, resources that are "open", such as unlicensed spectrum or a deployment of base stations open to all service providers, may offer greater gains in mmWave bands than at conventional cellular frequencies. However, even when sharing is technically beneficial (as recent research in this area suggests that it is), it may not be profitable. In this paper, both the technical and economic implications of resource sharing in millimeter wave networks are studied. Millimeter wave service is considered in the economic framework of a network good, and detailed network simulations are used to understand data rates, profit, and demand for millimeter wave service, with and without open resources. The results suggest that "open" deployments of neutral small cells that serve subscribers of any service provider encourage market entry by making it easier for networks to reach critical mass, more than "open" (unlicensed) spectrum would.},

abstract = {Internet connectivity on mobile devices is an essential commodity in today's world. While outdoors, most people connect through cellphone towers on 3G or 4G. However, cellphone tower coverage is not uniform and is affected by electromagnetic shadows cast by large structures, multipath, and absorption by various surfaces. Users with high data needs suffer in such locations due to insufficient network bandwidth. A similar insufficiency can also be felt by flash crowds in locations with otherwise moderate signal strength due to division of the available bandwidth.We explore the possibility of using drones as a solution to this problem. The drones can hover with direct line of sight with a cellphone tower and extend cellular coverage into the weaker regions. Our idea is to use the knowledge of large structures in the area to compute the expected SNR space around the client's current location. We use ray-tracing techniques to compute the expected SNR in an area. We then verify its similarity with ground truth by measuring, at several locations on the ground, the received signal strength from a Wifi router on a drone.},

Therefore, it is in demand for users to have fine-grained privacy protection and resources usage constraint that taking the context information into account, which is not supported by inherent access control mechanism of Android. To address these issues, we designed and implemented an enhanced context-aware adaptive access control system (EasyGuard) in Android to provide adaptive access control automatically when the specific context is detected according to the pre-configured policies. In addition, we developed an application to facilitate users that have little domain knowledge in android to configure policies reasonably.

Simultaneously, user preference for lighter phones has resulted in more battery power constrained hand-helds that offload computations to resource intensive cloud. This second trend exacerbates the bandwidth crunch often experienced over wireless networks. Our idea (joint cognitive offloading and scheduling) is to use dynamic spectrum access and management concepts from wireless networking to effect computation offloading and scheduling solutions that achieves near optimal trade-offs between the mobile device and wireless resources. We use all radio available interfaces (e.g. WiFi, LTE) in multi-RAT enabled devices to schedule appropriate components of the application to run either on the mobile device or on the resource-rich cloud, while staying adaptive to the conditions of the wireless network.},

abstract = {Existing WiFi fingerprinting-based Indoor Positioning System (IPS) suffers from the vulnerability of environmental dynamics. To address this issue, we propose TKL-WinSMS as a systematic strategy, which is able to realize robust and adaptive localization in dynamic indoor environments. We developed a WiFi-based Non-intrusive Sensing and Monitoring System (WinSMS) that enables COTS WiFi routers as online reference points by extracting real-time RSS readings among them. With these online data and labeled source data from the offline calibrated radio map, we further combine the RSS readings from target mobile devices as unlabeled target data, to design a robust localization model using an emerging transfer learning algorithm, namely transfer kernel learning (TKL). It can learn a domain-invariant kernel by directly matching the source and target distributions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space instead of the raw noisy signal space. By leveraging the resultant kernel as input for the SVR training, the trained localization model can inherit the information from online phase to adaptively enhance the offline calibrated radio map. Extensive experimental results verify the superiority of TKL-WinSMS in terms of localization accuracy compared with existing solutions in dynamic indoor environments.},

abstract = {With exponential growth of IoT devices [1], the 5G network will experience a variety of traffic patterns not prevalent in earlier applications. These, often will transmit short sporadic messages, which are not well suited to the connection-oriented modes associated with legacy 3GPP network resulting in high service latency and excessive control overhead. It is acknowledged that current 4G network could be overwhelmed by the surge in both traffic and control plane signaling load. For 5G, it is necessary to redesign the mobile network to provide a low delay, low control overhead IoT mode that will work efficiently for emerging application scenarios. The MAC layer has to be designed in such a way that IoT messages experience low access latency across both the radio access network and core network. The goal is to operate in the same band as current LTE, thus not requiring any separate bandwidth allocation and is backward compatible with the current 4G system. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer MAC and Physical layer solution for low power, low bitrate devices that require low access delay and long range for communication.},

abstract = {Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) is proposed in 802.11ac to achieve more than 3x faster than 802.11n. In the real world no-one gets close to theoretical speeds. The primary reason for this anomaly are the various overheads of channel access and channel state information (CSI) feedback. In order to achieve concurrent data transmission, (CSI) feedback from users is required. However, this overhead can easily overwhelm the actual channel time spent on data transmission in large-scale network. Moreover, due to spontaneous uplink traffic, which makes the problem even more challenging.In this paper, we propose a smart CSI feedback protocol called Gabriel. Firstly, Gabriel achieves alterable CSI feedback by evaluating its validity period to eliminate the unnecessary CSI feedback operation. Secondly, we introduce a new concept named 'large time slice' to solve fairness problem. Software-radio based implementation and testbed experimentation show that Gabriel significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CSI feedback reduction methods under various traffic patterns and node mobility.},

abstract = {Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) technique has emerged as a fundamental approach to mitigate the spectrum scarcity problem. As a key form of DSA, government is proposing to release more federal spectrum for sharing with commercial wireless users. However, the flourish of federal-commercial sharing hinges upon how the federal privacy is managed. In current DSA proposals, the sensitive exclusion zone (E-Zone) information of federal incumbent users (IUs) needs to be shared with a spectrum access system (SAS) to realize spectrum allocation. However, SAS is not necessarily trust-worthy for holding the sensitive IU E-Zone data, especially considering that FCC allows some industry third parties (e.g., Google) to operate SAS for better efficiency and scalability. Therefore, the current proposals dissatisfy the IUs' privacy requirement. To address the privacy issue, this paper presents an IU-privacy-preserving SAS (IP-SAS) design, which realizes the spectrum allocation process through secure computation over ciphertext based on homomorphic encryption.},

Adding new sensing modalities is a cumbersome process because it requires altering the deployed hardware. We introduce passive sensor tags that allow to easily and seamlessly add new sensors to existing IoT deployments without requiring hardware modifications or additional energy sources. Passive sensor tags employ backscatter communication to generate transmissions that can be decoded by the radio transceivers present in today's IoT devices. Furthermore, unlike recent works, our approach does not require dedicated infrastructure to generate the unmodulated carrier used for backscatter communication.The demo showcases our prototype of a passive sensor tag collecting sensor data and delivering it to unmodified commodity IoT devices using passive 802.15.4 transmissions.},

LiTell builds on the key observation that each FL has an inherent characteristic frequency, which can serve as a discriminative feature. It incorporates a set of sampling, signal amplification and camera optimization mechanisms, that enable a smartphone to capture the extremely weak and high frequency (&gt; 80 kHz) features. We have implemented LiTell as a real-time localization and navigation system on Android. In our experiments, LiTell demonstrates high reliability in discriminating different FLs, and great potential to achieve sub-meter granularity.},

abstract = {Visible Light Communication (VLC) emerges as a new wireless communication technology with appealing benefits not present in radio communication. However, current VLC designs commonly require LED lights to emit perceptible light beams, which greatly limits the applicable scenarios of VLC (e.g., in a sunny day when indoor lighting is not needed), and brings high energy overhead and unpleasant visual experiences for mobile devices to transmit data using VLC. We design and develop DarkLight, a new VLC primitive that allows light-based communication to be sustained even when LEDs emit extremely-low luminance. The key idea is to encode data into ultra-short, imperceptible light pulses. We tackle challenges in circuit designs, data encoding/decoding schemes, and DarkLight networking, to efficiently generate and reliably detect ultra-short light pulses using off-the-shelf, low-cost LEDs and photodiodes. Our DarkLight prototype supports 1.3-m distance with 1.6-Kbps data rate. By loosening up VLC's reliance on visible light beams, DarkLight presents an unconventional direction of VLC and fundamentally broadens VLC's application scenarios.},

abstract = {Emerging mobile applications involve continuous sensing and complex computations on sensed data streams. Examples include cognitive apps (e.g., speech recognition, natural language translation, as well as face, object, or gesture detection and recognition) and anticipatory apps that proactively track and provide services when needed. Unfortunately, today's mobile devices cannot keep pace with such apps, despite advances in hardware capability. Traditional approaches address this problem by computation offloading. One approach offloads by sending sensed streams to remote cloud servers via cellular networks or to cloudlets via Wi-Fi, where a clone of the app runs [2, 3, 4]. However, cloudlets may not be widely deployed and access to cloud infrastructure may yield high network delays and can be intermittent due to mobility. Morever, users might hesitate to upload private sensing data to the cloud or cloudlet. A second approach offloads to accelerators by rewriting code to use DSP or GPU within mobile devices. However, using accelerators requires substantial programming effort and produces varied benefits for diverse codes on heterogeneous devices.},

abstract = {VibKeyboard could accurately determine the location of a keystroke on extended surface areas leveraging a single vibration sensor. Unlike capacitive sensing, it does not require conductive materials and compared to audio sensing it is more robust to acoustic noise. In VibKeyboard, the received vibration signals are determined by the location of the touch impact. This allows location discrimination of touches precise enough to enable emerging applications such as virtual keyboards on ubiquitous surfaces for mobile devices. VibKeyboard seeks to extract unique features in frequency domain embedded in the vibration signal attenuation and interference and perform fine grained localization. Our experimental results demonstrate that VibKeyboard could accurately recognize keystrokes from close-by keys on a nearby virtual keyboard.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in audio recording on mobile devices have improved audio localization capabilities using phones. Previous research has shown that millimeter level accuracy is capable using an off-the-shelf smartphone. This work demonstrates that such valuable resources in smartphones are readily available for developing consumer applications. We develop a smartphone application called HearHere that utilizes geometric features of sound to categorize a tapping sound within a grid. The geometric features are based on the Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) of the sound between two microphones. By using this classification, any off the shelf phone with stereo recording capability can be made into a music producing device. The application consists of three major components: system calibration, data collection, and audio localization engine based on TDoA. We demonstrate that we can accurately map the tapping sound six region on various solid surface and turn it into a MIDI controller with six different types of instruments.},

abstract = {With the increasing programmability and fast-paced dynamics of modern wireless systems, it has become more difficult to gain timely insights into wireless network operations. In this demonstration1 we present WiART, an augmented reality framework to help visualize and interact with wireless network activities in real time. WiART collects real-time radio and network statistics from participating network devices and depicts them on users' mobile devices in an intuitive way, leveraging the virtual information overlay of augmented reality. Specifically in our current implementation, WiART takes inputs from a cognitive radio link controlling beam-steerable reconfigurable antennas and annotates on a live mobile screen the active pre-measured radiation patterns. In the reverse flow, WiART enables users to select desired antenna radiation patterns directly in the mobile app and observe their effects on link performance in real time. These capabilities add an unprecedented level of instant visualization and interaction with wireless activities and provides valuable insights into the dynamics of a reconfigurable antenna-based cognitive radio network.},
