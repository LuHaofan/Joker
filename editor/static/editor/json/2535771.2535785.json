Our key insight is that if radios could measure the backscatter of their own transmissions (i.e. reflections from the environment of their transmissions), then Tricorder-style powerful object detection and localization algorithms could be realized. In this paper we focus specifically on backscatter measurement, we describe novel circuits and algorithms that can be added to existing radios to enable them to accurately and concurrently receive and disentangle their own transmissions' reflections and infer its properties.", "tags": ["tricorder-style powerful object detection", "powerful multipurpose scanning devices", "localization algorithms", "backscatter measurement", "i.e. reflections", "novel circuits", "human bodies", "algorithms", "tumors", "radios", "guns"], "booktitle": "Proceedings of the Twelfth ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks", "numpages": "7", "location": "College Park, Maryland", "series": "HotNets-XII"}
