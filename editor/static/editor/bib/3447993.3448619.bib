abstract = {Overcoming the conventional trade-off between throughput and bit error rate (BER) performance, versus computational complexity is a long-term challenge for uplink Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) detection in base station design for the cellular 5G New Radio roadmap, as well as in next generation wireless local area networks. In this work, we present ParaMax, a MIMO detector architecture that for the first time brings to bear physics-inspired parallel tempering algorithmic techniques [28, 50, 67] on this class of problems. ParaMax can achieve near optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) throughput performance in the Large MIMO regime, Massive MIMO systems where the base station has additional RF chains, to approach the number of base station antennas, in order to support even more parallel spatial streams. ParaMax is able to achieve a near ML-BER performance up to 160 \texttimes{} 160 and 80 \texttimes{} 80 Large MIMO for low-order modulations such as BPSK and QPSK, respectively, only requiring less than tens of processing elements. With respect to Massive MIMO systems, in 12 \texttimes{} 24 MIMO with 16-QAM at SNR 16 dB, ParaMax achieves 330 Mbits/s near-optimal system throughput with 4--8 processing elements per subcarrier, which is approximately 1.4\texttimes{} throughput than linear detector-based Massive MIMO systems.},
